commentary

"1 run, dragged down on off, the batsman can't put this away either. Hauls a pull to deep square leg."
"1 wide, full outside leg stump. Dhawan tries to sweep, but can't connect."
"FOUR runs, full on off, and the batsman crunches this over mid on! In the batsman's arc, and he check-drives it to the on side. Enough behind it to beat the infield."
"1 run, full and wide outside off. Flighted and driven to deep extra cover. Mistimed, though."
"1 run, a slower ball down leg, worked to deep square leg for one."
"no run, a slower ball outside off, good change in pace, and angle (the ball going away instead of coming in). Pushed to cover point.."
"1 run, full on off, shuffles across and clips it into the vacant spaces at midwicket."
"FOUR runs, the batsman marches down the track again, meets a back-of-a-length ball outside off, and crunches it over the bowler's head. Pinged off the middle of the bat to the straight boundary."
"OUT, traps him in front, but the batsman has reviewed! It's the knuckle ball - now that's a story to tell, the batsman's a legend with that variation but he doesn't pick it. Swings all across the line, feet planted in the crease. Replays says there is no bat, HawkEye says it is clipping just enough of leg stump to make it umpire's call.."
"FOUR runs, unlucky! The pace earns Hardik another boundary. Goes for the wide yorker, and Hardik's wild slash takes the bat's toe end. Goes between third man and the keeper this time."
"FOUR runs, clever, very clever. Made room to slap this over point but Avesh cramped him for room. the batsman now changes his stroke and uses the pace to help this wide of short third man.."
"SIX runs, who cares if the opposition just sparked to life? I'ma see this length ball and pulverise it over long-on. Thank you very much. That's what's going on in the batsman's head. I'm paraphrasing, of course.."
"no run, back of a length and outside off, the batsman lets it through."

"1 run, hurries the batsman for pace as he gets a thick inside edge on the drive to mid on, quick single scampered."
"2 runs, smashed down to long-off. A slower ball is hammered back past the bowler. the bowler sticks out his right hand, but the ball flies past. Pollard throws to the batsman's end, but he's fine."
"no run, full and wide outside off. the batsman tries to drive with the bat's open face, but it's mistimed. Straight to point."
"1 run, Dhawan flies to his right and can't hold on! Oh what a catch that would have been! the bowler gets it to rise in the corridor and the batsman fends at it with hard hands. It is sailing high and very wide of Dhawan at wide slip. He does superbly to even reach it. But can only parry it to third man."
"1 wide, tossed wide outside off and breaks away further, off-side wide."

"1 run, short ball, the batsman can't get on top of that as he pulls away to midwicket."
"1 run, full on middle and leg, eased to long on."
"OUT, off the pad or bat? Pad, says the umpire. Daredevils want to review. It's a good-length delivery outside off, the batsman gets right across and works the ball into his pad, and then to short fine leg. Big inside edge and that decision should be out. A successful review, can make a big difference to the total. Was looking for the ramp over short fine leg, but insufficient contact to beat his thigh.."

"1 wide, cutter outside off, but the umpire thinks it's too wide. Hardik had let it go anyway. the bowler's not pleased with the umpire's call. Looked like it was just inside the tramlines though!."
"1 run, full toss, whips powerfully to long-on and Jadeja runs to his left and makes a brilliant stop sliding across."

"1 run, tossed outside off, presses forward and drives through the covers."
"no run, tosses it up wide outside off and the batsman drives to cover."

"no run, full on leg stump, and straightens after pitching. the batsman misses the leg-side tap, and it comes off his pads."
"1 run, full on middle stump, and the batsman's smart to simply play it down the ground for a single. It's already been an expensive over, and all they need to do is see the over out."

"SIX runs, picks the googly beautifully! Full outside off, and slogs this with the spin over deep midwicket! Sixth IPL batsman to get to 4000 runs. What a way to reach the milestone.."

"OUT, full on the pads and he's flicked this straight to Dhawan at deep midwicket. Out comes the Kabaddi thump. Oh, dear. the batsman has thrown it away.."
"1 run, fizzing cutter, swerves away outside off, past the outside edge. The keeper is beaten as well by the bounce or the lack of it. They sneak in a bye."

"no run, googly, breaks back in, the batsman does not pick it, swings and manages an inside edge onto the pad."

"1 run, opens the face to try and find some runs behind point. There are none and so the batsman is sent back. Mandeep hits the stumps direct and they pinch a single off the overthrow. Then the man backing up hits the stumps direct at the non-strikers now. Two perfect throws, no wickets."

"1 run, the googly outside off, Dhawan lets it turn away and taps it to off for one."

"no run, nearly a yorker outside off and it's steered to point where Raina puts in a dive."
"no run, didn't pick this properly but somehow managed to get this back to the bowler. Sharp leggie there."
"FOUR runs, overpitched and outside off, another poor ball from the bowler, Rohit simply leans into it, collapses his back leg, and drives it through the covers, beats sweeper cover to his right."
"SIX runs, shot. the bowler looks for the off-stump yorker this time and doesn't miss his length by much. But the batsman takes a big step back into his crease to create some swinging room, and simply lifts it over mid-off."
"(no ball), waist-high full toss way outside off, and the ball hits the batsman's shoulder. Tried to paddle it over his shoulder once again, but this time it didn't come off the bat. Ouch. Free hit as well."
"FOUR runs, around the wicket and it doesn't work! It just doesn't work! the batsman is batting on another level. He sees the length earlier than he should. He can only see the gaps. And so his backing away and cutting the ball between point and short third man is academic really."
"SIX runs, pulled and this is into the second tier at deep square leg. Picked the length early, swivelled back and smacked that away.."
"2 runs, nicely played but some quality fielding out at long-on. Full ball on leg stump is drilled between long-on and deep midwicket. A slide to the right from long-on and a quick pick up and throw from deep midwicket, both of whom had to be inch perfect to avoid a collision."
"1 run, poor from Mujeeb! Drops this at short third man. It was slow and short outside off, and the batsman tried to ramp it over short third man. Slices it, but a lazy effort from Mujeeb."

"2 runs, works it off his hips to long leg, and Rashid hits the turf after being off-balance in trying to throw the ball in quickly."
"1 run, full toss on middle stump, and the batsman's leg-side push doesn't come off. Appeal for lbw by the bowler, but Erasmus thinks that was bat first. Yep, he's spot on."
"1 run, short of a length, spinning away towards off, whipped down to long-on."
"FOUR runs, paddled over short fine. Not entirely in control, it looked like, but it flew over the infield. Axar once again punished for firing it in. Hasn't learnt.."
"1 run, steps out, opens up the off side and lofts this inside out to deep extra cover. Had control over his stroke, just a gentle chip."

"no run, full awayswinger in the corridor, defended to point off the outside half."
"OUT, yorker on leg stump! the batsman shuffled across to the off side to try and clip it off his toes, but misses. Tried to take advantage of short fine-leg being inside the circle, but Hardik went wicket-to-wicket."
"FOUR runs, dragged down outside off, the batsman sizes it up and cracks it it away past the left of Mujeeb. He does not get his body behind the ball and concedes four."
"OUT, the bowler hushes the Chinnaswamy into silence. He goes short and outside off, the batsman upper cuts it in the air and holes out to Karun Nair at deep point.  the bowler gives Kings XI hope. RCB need 10 off 11 balls."
"FOUR runs, nicely done. the batsman has almost become a specialist at this one-legged, no-balance shot to fine leg. This time it's off the spinner of course. Length ball fired down leg and he swivels to tap it on its head."

"1 run, brings it shorter and he goes back in the crease to whip it to leg for one."
"no run, slower ball, on and around off stump, the batsman picks it up rather late, tries to punch it down the ground. Makes no contact as the ball flicks the top flap of the pad and goes through to the keeper."
"OUT, aesthetically beauty is where the batsman's inside-out loft over extra cover stops. He's not fully to the pitch and as a result, he's ended up slicing a very good looking shot to sweeper's left. The fielder runs a few yards to his left and watches carefully before completing the catch."
"no run, length on off stump, punched to mid-off on the up."

"2 runs, full and angled across, hammered away wide of long-off."
"OUT, edged and de Kock throws himself to his right to snag the catch. Pitched up and outside off, the batsman throws his hands at a drive and nicks it behind. De Kock completes an outstanding catch."
"1 run, back of a length and skidding in, the batsman is cramped up as he inside-edges the ball beside his feet. Mitch McC swoops in and attacks the ball. Rayudu slides his bat in time."
"1 run, 114.8ks knuckle ball on middle stump, the batsman delays his push and plays it to mid-off."

"FOUR runs, 110.8ks, back of a length and outside off, Axar reads the change-up and smears it away to the midwicket boundary."

"1 run, fullish length ball, sliding on leg, tucked away to midwicket."

DK drove that straight to point and took off, Lynn wasn't sure and was nearly stuck on the pitch but DK was a long way down before Southee misses.

"1 run, good length on off and angling away from the batsman. Slapped off the back foot to the man in the deep."
"FOUR runs, a misfield, and another boundary. Shorter, faster on off, goes back and punches to the left of cover, where the fielder puts in a lazy effort."

"no run, the bowler nails a wide yorker outside off, beats the batsman."
"no run, all action first-up. Inswinger from Trent the bowler. Not given. Iyer reviews. Good length and snakes back in, the batsman plays around his front pad - like he has done for the most of his career - and is pinned below the knee-roll. Pitching in line: check. Hitting the stumps: check. The tracker returns three reds. There was an inside edge but bat first or pad first? There is no conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field not-out call. This was really tight but the batsman survives in the end."
"1 run, really full on middle, the batsman stretches out and sweeps it away to deep square leg. You don't often see the batsman sweeping."
"1 run, short ball, forces him to arch back with pace and no room,the batsman does well to control his shot through midwicket."

"FOUR runs, full ball, but on leg stump. Too easy for the batsman, who simply clips it off his toes fine down the leg side. Eleven off the bowler' first over."

"1 run, full outside off, bottom-handed shovel to long-off."
"no run, the batsman struggling to account for the bounce! Back of a length outside off, another swing and miss.."
"1 run, throws his hands at a wide one and gets a thick outside edge towards third man."
"no run, the bowler lobs it up outside off and gets it to break away, the batsman reaches out for the googly and is beaten on the outside edge. Ultra Edge detects a spike, and this means DK has dropped it. It went quickly to DK, too difficult to close his gloves around the ball."
"1 run, off the mark straightaway by punching that through the covers."
"SIX runs, shot! A short one that climbs into him hurriedly, and the batsman jumps and flays it over the third man region with a well-timed ramp."

"OUT, another one that hurries the batsman! This is a batsman brought up in Victoria. A 148.7kph short delivery outside off, the batsman this time, looks for the pull through midwicket, but he is too late on the shot. Takes the splice of the bat and lobs to cover. Clearly, harried for pace and Avesh strikes. Some pace and bounce in this surface.."

"no run, full and outside off, the batsman backs away and muscles it to the covers. Another dot."
"no run, a big appeal, pad first, think Mumbai. But it's a legbreak that may have struck Yusuf outside the line. With the spin, that's missing off stump too. But Mumbai want to review. It is pad first, but that needed to be a googly. Yusuf got forward and looked to defend, the ball struck him outside the line and the spin is also taking that away from the stumps, says HawkEye.."

"no run, another short delivery, back of a length outside off. the batsman can't connect with his attempt to pull to square leg."

"1 run, flat and quick on the pads, nudged to midwicket for a run."

"1 run, sliced over the infield, down to Rashid at sweeper cover."

"2 runs, picked off through midwicket for a double."
"4 runs, Jadeja with a brilliant save but have theu run four? Yes, they have. the batsman whipped this uppishly through deep midwicket. Jadeja ran across a long way from deep square leg and did well to get down to it but ended up pulling it away too forcefully.

"OUT, the inswinging yorker has done the trick. Gets this to bend back in a long way from outside off from around the stumps, the batsman jams his bat down late as the ball bounces into the stumps. 'Should I, should I not?' the ball thought to itself before disturbing the bails."

"no run, good length outside off, and Rinku plays off the back foot towards point."

Suryakumar swooped in and sent it a flat throw to the bowler well before Lynn could reach the crease."

"FOUR runs, chopped past first slip! Raina's dive to his right sn't good enough. It was too close to his body for the cut, but he played it anyway. Off the bat's edge, but just beyond Raina. Third man can't intercept either."
"no run, 132 kph, full outside off, chopped away towards backward point.."
"SIX runs, full on leg stump, and in the batsman's slot. Big wind up, and then swings with the bat's full followthrough. Smacked into the long-on boundary."
"2 runs, short on middle, and going down the leg side. the batsman whips it off his pads to deep midwicket. Played gently enough, and that allows him to take the second run."
"no run, under-edged to the keeper? Did it hit the stump? Given out. Back of a length outside off, the batsman looks to cut the ball down to third man but the ball clips the top of the front pad. That was the big noise. The ball was close to the bat also, but UltraEdge says just pad, not bat. They will have to check for the lbw also. Impact says outside off stump so the batsman will continue on."
"no run, slightly full outside off and not much swing, QdK reaches out and steers it to cover point."

"no run, seam-up, full and outside off, driven through the line to the covers."

"OUT, The back-of-a-length ball works for the bowler and CSK again. That's the right length to bowl here in Pune. the batsman shimmies out again, the bowler pulls his length back and attacks the body of the batsman. He aims to slog it away but only toe-ends it to Karn at deep midwicket."

"OUT, sensational catch by Hardik Pandya, off his bro's bowling. A slower delivery outside off, the ball is flighted and loopy. The ball spins away but the batsman can't back down from his hit over cover. But because of that spin, the ball skews away off the outside half. Hardik runs around to his left, keeps his eyes on the ball and dives full length to get both hands on the ball to clasp the ball. But he doesn't let go of the ball even as his body and arm and shoulder hits the ground. Terrific catch.."

"FOUR runs, hip-high short ball outside off, back-of-the-hand slower ball, the batsman waits for it to arrive and swats it away to the wide long-on boundary. Fetch that."

"1 run, squeezes out this yorker towards square leg.."
"OUT, top edge is taken this time. Looks like the batsman was late on the slog sweep this time. the bowler gets some grip from a good length and marginal turn away from off stump. He completes a simple catch too."

"1 run, good length outside off, and angling into Hardik. Cut off the back foot to point for a quick run. Off the mark."

"1 run, dug short on off, slugged away to deep square leg."
"1 leg bye, on a length outside off, spins back in to beat the inside edge and hit the pad. The appeal for lbw is shot down.

"OUT, the bowler strikes first ball! Kings XI continue to fight. His first ball is a flick out of the front of the hand, it pitches outside off and spins back in with the angle and the direction of release. It finds a massive gap between bat and pad and knocks into off stump. Daredevils are in some trouble.."
"1 run, slider, back of a length on middle stump. Drags it to deep square's left with a pull off the inside half."

"1 run, very full on middle, driven down to long-off off the front foot."
"no run, does him in with drift and flight that draws him forward, and turn as it spins away and beats him with the backfoot coming off. Slides it back in."
"1 run, straying into the pads, flicked crisply to deep square leg."
"FOUR runs, banged in short and aimed at the head of the batsman, he top-edges a hook fine of short fine leg. Fortunate runs for CSK and the batsman."

"1 run, a googly, wide outside off. Smashed back, right through the hands of the bowler as he dives to his right."
"1 run, length ball angled in at off stump. Closes the face and drags it to mid-on's left off the front foot."
"2 runs, good length on leg stump, and easily turned off his hips to deep backward square. Played softly, which actually allows them to take the second."
"1 wide, one more wide, this one's gone far down the off side. Pressure goes back to the bowler after a really good start."

"1 run, back of a length, cuts in, flicks to deep midwicket."

"no run, back of a length and angling in, the batsman uses his feet and turns it to leg side."
"OUT, trapped in front of middle and off! Half-tracker outside off and holds its line. Too quick for the batsman, and the ball stays low too, as the batsman misses the leg-side whip. Goes under his bat, and hits his front leg. An easy call for the umpire."
"FOUR runs, 114.7ks slower ball on of, the batsman forces the pace. He bends his back knee and swats it across to the midwicket fence."
"no run, full and outside off, skips away in the channel, 143.6ks, the batsman is late onto a drive and is beaten for pace and late swing."
"SIX runs, just over midwicket. That's bottom hand, all over. Comes running down and chips the ball into that area. The timing is so good that it clears Johnson, running around.."
"no run, slower offcutter on off, defended back to the bowler."
"no run, full on leg stump, and the batsman's on drive takes a leading edge! Falls short of cover though."

"1 run, slider outside off, forced down to long-on for one."
"1 run, wide legbreak, the batsman reaches out for the ball and carves it to backward point."
"no run, full outside off, but spins sharply into the batsman. Blocked off the back foot with the bat's open face. Excellent over from Rashid."
"no run, shuffles across and blocks watchfully towards mid-on."
"OUT, another duck for Kishan! Third duck in four innings. Full on off stump, and swings into Kishan's pads. He tries to drive towards mid on, but there's a big gap between bat and pad. The ball sneaks through and crashes into off middle stump. Perfect start for Bangalore."
"no run, pretty full and outside off, tapped to point again. the bowler begins with two dots."
"no run, fuller than a good length and swings back in sharply from over the wicket, the batsman is tucked up for room and an inside edge saves him."
"2 runs, pitched up with some room and the batsman has cleverly driven that square, almost beating the fielder. De Grandhomme runs across to his left behind square and slides to just keep the ball in. The third umpire is checking and looks fine."
"FOUR runs, full toss on the pads. Go pick it up from the boundary.  the batsman doesn't have to move. Deep midwicket is powerless to his right."
"no run, the batsman now attempts a reverse-sweep and gloves it to short third man."
"no run, the bowler belts out an appeal for a leg before as the batsman gets down to sweep and is hit on the pad. Not out is the on-field call, and it seems as though the impact may be outside off, but the bowler convinces Gambhir to go for the review. Oops, seems like it may be well outside off. Also got to rule out the under-edge on the sweep. That seems alright, and the impact is miles outside off. Horrific review."
"1 leg bye, advances down the ground and gets hit on the pad as he tries to heave it away to the leg side. Rolls into the off side off the pad."
"no run, good length outside off, and that back-foot punch is timed well. But straight to cover."
"no run, inswinger from the bowler, on a good length, the batsman flicks and falls over. He wears it on the pad but this is heading down the leg side. Sharp first over from the bowler."

"1 run, flicks a length ball off the pads through midwicket."
"FOUR runs, back of a length and outside off, 145ks, the extra pace of the bowler works to the batsman' advantage. He stands tall and unleashes a jabbing punch through extra cover. Fetch that."
"no run, back of a length, but just outside off. Fended off the back foot towards cover."
"no run, bouncer - at top pace - and Yusuf is comfortably beaten on the hook shot."

"1 run, straightens from length on middle, the batsman looks to work to the leg side, but gets a leading edge that rolls wide of cover."
"1 run, nice and full on off stump, opens the face and dabs a single to backward point. Rayudu swoops down on the ball but does not connect with a direct hit at the striker's end. Parthiv would have been out he had nailed the stumps."
"1 run, back of a length outside off, and too close to DK's body for the cut. Chooses to chop it down to third man."
"1 run, dropped! the batsman's attempted ramp is poorly timed. It looks like the bowler's getting bouncers to stick in the pitch. It's a lob that goes behind Rana who is at fly slip and he can't hold on after pedalling backwards and tumbling."
"1 wide, very full and drifting down leg for a wide. Re-set the radar, Mr. the bowler."
"no run, on a length and outside off, sticks in the pitch, dabbed to point."

"1 run, punches this length ball to deep cover."
"no run, flat around middle and leg, pushed back to the bowler this time.."
"2 runs, backs away, the bowler follows him. Bunted towards deep midwicket. A direct hit at the bowler's end from Finch would've spelt trouble for Pandey."
"no run, slower ball, short outside off. the batsman has to wait ages before the ball comes to him, and he misses the cut completely. Bounces over the batsman's blade, and through to Rahul on the bounce."

"no run, short of a length just outside off, punched to mid-off off the back foot."
"no run, usual leg break, which hardly spins, much slower on the off stump and he defends again."

"no run, wide yorker, sneaks under the bat."
"OUT, knocked him over! Played one shot too many. Shaped to pull but the length wasn't there for the stroke, beat the inside edge and crashed into the off stump. Completely missed the line, made matters tougher by trying to play across the line. He's given them a good start though.."
"SIX runs, what a shot! All wrists. Full and straight, Suryakumar brings out the wrists, stays besides the ball and flicks, the ball then flies away over backward square leg. Lovely batting.."
"no run, much fuller and sliding in on middle from around the wicket, catches the batsman on the crease. He quietly defends it to the off side."

"1 run, punched down the ground for one."
"no run, full outside off, and the batsman cuts it hard. Straight to point however."

"no run, lifter outside off, the batsman aims cut it away but is beaten by extra bounce."
"SIX runs, half-tracker that the batsman pulls way over the deep midwicket fence. Too easy, pie that was asking to be hit."
"no run, short ball, lots of width, the batsman can't capitalise because he's standing miles away from it, somewhere outside the leg-stump. Reaches out for a slap and barely knocks it to the cover and point reigon."

"FOUR runs, the umpire ducks as the batsman charges down and slaps the short of length ball over the bowler's head with sheer disdain. He's looking in ominuous form."
"no run, drifts in a quicker delivery on the pads, turned to short fine leg."
"FOUR runs, good length outside off, and the ball spins away from the batsman again. He tries to hit it over cover, but the batsman manages to slice this over point! Kaul chases after it, but the ball picks up pace after hitting the practice pitches. Can't pull it back."
"FOUR runs, flat length ball angling into the pads, and the batsman tucks it away neatly, nice and fine and the man at deep backward square leg is too far from the ball to even be in the frame."
"1 run, short ball, pulled out to deep midwicket."
"1 run, punched on the up to sweeper cover."

"SIX runs, just clears Vijay Shankar at deep square leg! Oh that's really close. Length ball lifting up at him as he walks into it. Whips his wrists at this to pick it up. Shankar sprints to his left and puts in a big leap to his left - and he's a tall man - but he can't get a hand on this."
"FOUR runs, good length just outside off, but sharp angle into the batsman's body. He goes onto the back foot, and defends with the bat's open face. Takes the outside edge, and goes past Dhoni's right to the boundary."
"FOUR runs, change of angle, no problem. Slaps this length ball over extra cover, raced to the boundary in a jiffy.."

"no run, full, angled across, the batsman jams the bat down and gets beaten."
"1 run, tossed up on leg stump, worked to deep midwicket."

"2 runs, an overpitched start to begin. Full and wide, Suryakumar the batsman smashes that drive to Gambhir at mid-off, who labours to his left. A fumble allows two.."
"no run, googly. Length ball outside off. Blocked solidly on the front foot."
"2 runs, top edge, it goes really really high and just avoids Dhoni who runs back all the way and then flicks the ball inside the boundary to save two. De Kock pulled the short ball and his heart must have been in his mouth after that went high, but it went back over the keeper."
"1 run, starts with a slower ball around off, worked away to deep square leg for a single.."
"no run, shortish outside off, the batsman misses his swing.."
"no run, big lbw appeal from the bowler, it was a really really slow yorker and beat the batsman completely, hitting him near the knee on the back foot. Looks like Dhoni didn't want to review."

"FOUR runs, too straight again and picked away. Not been a great over, 135 kph, on the pads. the batsman just gets a bit of bat on that and tickles the ball fine, to the fine leg boundary.."
"1 run, fired full on off stump, worked with the spin past midwicket."
"1 run, short offcutter on leg stump again. Thigh-high. Pulled straight to square leg."

"2 runs, pushed through outside off, stretches out, rolls his wrists, and sweeps it flat and hard behind square."
"no run, back of a length and spins in, chopped to cover."
"SIX runs, this has been smacked over deep extra cover. Is that a no-ball? Thought I saw the umpire's right hand go out as he bowled the delivery. Missed his length completely, looking for a wide yorker, and Rohit picked that away. Okay, so this isn't a no-ball.."
"no run, short of a length on off stump, backs away and taps to extra cover on the up."

"FOUR runs, shot. Length ball on middle and he gets down nice and early to swat this behind square with a nicely connected sweep."

"2 runs, full on leg stump, and he taps it towards the vacant mid-wicket region. the bowler has to go chasing behind it."
"OUT, Munro at cow corner! And that's the Purple cap for the bowler. Full on off stump, and the batsman's leg-side whip is mistimed. In the air for ages as Munro comes running in. Takes a sharp catch with the floodlights disturbing his vision for certain."
"no run, big appeal! But turned down. Keeper says impact's outside off, so they choose not to review. It was full outside off, and the batsman tried to sweep it square. Hit his front leg."
"OUT, the perfect yorker! It starts from wide of the crease, hones in on middle and leg, takes a detour off the front pad and knocks over middle. Top stuff from the uncapped fast bowler, who now has four wickets in the game."
"1 run, 89 kph, slow down leg, nudged to short fine leg for one.."

"no run, another fast wrong'un from Rashid. the batsman picks it off the pitch and jabs to cover."
"no run, 141ks full-toss wide outside off, the batsman reaches out for the ball but misses again. Dhoni slapped a similar full-toss over the point boundary the other night at the Chinnaswamy."
"1 wide, Nifty footwork from the batsman! Half-tracker on leg  stump and the batsman misses the pull. Hits the keeper, and falls back into the batsman's pads. He isn't sure where the ball is, so chooses to wriggle the ball out of his body."
"OUT, First-ball duck for the batsman. 114.3ks slower full ball on off, the batsman ventures down the track and slices this knuckle ball to Tiwary at long-off."

"1 leg bye, leg-side length ball, the batsman backs away and cops it on the pad as he misses his flick."

"no run, sees the batsman trying to move across and bowls this wide, left alone in anticipation of this being called wide, but this isn't.."
"no run, proper cross-batted heave! Opens up the leg side to pull but was beaten by the slower delivery that angled in to hit him on the right thigh.."
"SIX runs, that's another poor delivery. the bowler is nicely feeding to the batsmen's strengths here. Lots of room outside off, and all he swings across without moving his feet but still manages good meat to clear long-on by a distance."

"no run, non-turning offbreak on off, the batsman presses forward and smothers it."

"no run, shortish, tries to heave a pull and mistimes it along the ground to midwicket."

"1 run, shortish on off stump, steers it towards point."
"FOUR runs, long-hop outside off, the batsman jumps onto the back foot and nails a pull between deep midwicket and long-on. Duly put away."

"no run, full and shaping away late outside off, the batsman swings and the ball sneaks past the inside edge."
"OUT, taken at long-on! Sarfraz picks out the fielder. That was a stumbling, stalling innings. Full outside off, Sarfraz mis-times a lofted drive down the throat of long-on. Kohli isn't happy Sarfraz didn't go through with the shot.."

"1 run, back of a length and outside off, flat-batted away to wide mid-off, where Siraj lets it burst through his hands. the batsman stepped out and swatted it away."
"1 run, delicate, but only a single. Full on off, and he reverse paddles it to short third man."

That was excellent bowling from Mumbai, taking pace off the ball, bowling outside his preferred hitting areas. He's frustrated and therefore has a hoick at a length offcutter on middle. The ball takes the outside half of the bat and splices to deep midwicket.."

"OUT, a bit too full for the sweep, the batsman is beaten and has been given out lbw by umpire Erasmus. Did that pitch in line? the batsman chats with Baz and calls for a review.

The tracker suggests it pitched on leg stump and would have clipped the outside of the leg stump. the batsman has to go. Over to Kohli to rescue RCB again."

"FOUR runs, 116.4ks, short and wide outside off, the batsman, having stepped away outside leg, tests out his calf, reaches out for the ball. Delays his shot and scythes it away to the left of backward point. Mr.IPL brings up his first fifty of the season."

"1 run, slower back of a length delivery, opens the face to point."

"2 runs, tossed up, but full outside off. Squeezed away towards wide long on, and collects a couple more."

"OUT, aims midwicket again and that's curtains! Hardik the batsman has sliced one to third man! Same line and length three balls in a row, same shot offered with no result.

Unadkat falls to his right to try and stop it, and doesn't cover for the ball spinning away from him - should have known because the batsman sliced it."
"no run, good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot."

"1 run, low full toss, slanted across, pushed down to long-off."

"FOUR runs, pulled! Almost like he knew what was coming. Hardik drops short, the batsman stands his ground and pulls handsomely in front of square, one bounce into the ropes.."
"no run, has he gloved this? Big appeal but the umpire is unmoved. the batsman looks to hop across and whip this but misses. The ball may have brushed his thigh pad on the way."
"1 run, bunts it into the off side as they scamper a single. Good start, hit the deck hard at length, Surya got this high on the bat towards point."
"no run, leg-stump yorker, squeezed back to the bowler."
"1 run, full, wide, slashed to sweeper cover."
"1 run, good length on middle and angling away from the batsman. Goes onto the back foot, and whips this down the ground to long on. Gets Munro on strike for the first time."

"1 run, off-stump yorker, dug out through cover-point."
"2 runs, full-toss on middle, tapped to cow corner for a double."
"SIX runs, he's clobbered this and it sails over long on. Steps out and swings this length delivery up and over. Held his pose for the cameras as well. Clean striking right out of the top drawer."
"1 run, full on off, and that's hit back hard to the bowler. He can't get his fingertips to it, and the ball runs down to long on."
"1 run, slower ball, full on leg stump. Tapped with soft hands towards the vacant mid-wicket region. They scamper across for the run."
"FOUR runs, slapped away, a misfield at cover means there's a boundary. Should've been a dot. Oh, dear. The fielder? Sanju Samson."
"no run, another slower ball, pushed to mid-off. Good end from Mumbai."
"1 run, full outside off, but zipping into the batsman's pads. Tried to cut after backing away, but takes the inside edge. It goes between his legs and through to the leg side."
"1 run, length ball, sliding on leg, gets down for a reverse sweep and crunches it to sweeper cover."
"OUT, taken at midwicket. Length ball at off stump, turning away from him. Steps out as it climbs on him. Looks to go over the leg side but ends up slicing it high into the air."
"OUT, the short ball does the trick again! Almost 142kph this time, and the batsman took his eyes off while trying to pull. Mistimes the shot, and it's the easiest of catches for Avesh. Cups his hands and collects his wicket."
"1 run, good length on off, and it's been pulled past square leg this time. Not hit well enough."
"no run, good length outside off, and poked off the back foot. Takes the outside edge, but only to Lynn at short third man. No runs off the bat in the over."
"no run, 141 kph, a low full toss outside off, sliced to short third man. Markande goes flying to his left and stops the ball, to the awe of the crowd.."
"FOUR runs, short and wide outside off, and the batsman's forced to reach at it. Cuts it anyway, and manages to get it over the infield. Beats the man at deep extra cover too!."
"1 run, OUT, What a horrible mix-up between the wickets. Farcical running. But the batsman and Raina laugh it off. the batsman raises his bat and walks off. This was short and wide outside off, flat-batted away to wide long-off, where Pandey, one of India's best fielders, fumbles. the batsman senses an opportunity for an extra run. Raina also (seemingly) calls for the second. Pandey throws the ball to the bowler, who fumbles too. He then runs after the ball, tags it to Williamson, who takes the bails off to catch the batsman short at the non-striker's end. the batsman can't undo his steps in time."
"no run, full and angling in on middle stump, the batsman still hangs back and defends."
"OUT, is that an edge? Oh, yeah! Tucked up for room and some extra bounce too that does him in. the batsman is trying to slap this over but gets a feather to the keeper. Gone for 20 but he Kings XI will be pleased he didn't scratch around."
"no run, full on off stump. Very accurate, and the batsman gives the delivery the respect it deserves. Defended off the front foot."
"1 run, cutter dropped short on middle stump. Drags the pull to deep square on the bounce."
"SIX runs, knuckle ball on middle, but it's on a good length. Comes into the batsman's body, and he simply gets his front foot out of the way to tonk it over long on! 103 metres."
"1 run, slower ball outside off, and that's been mistimed down the ground to long on. A gentle punch."
"1 run, length and angled in at leg stump. Flicked uppishly towards deep square."
"no run, chops this attempted cut into the off side, the bowler hares across to stop that."
"1 run, fuller outside off, and this time it's been driven past the non-striker to the man at long on."
"FOUR runs, too short, too slow, and Curran rocks back and pulls that away nicely between long on and deep midwicket. Almost pin-drop silence at the ground."
"1 run, full and wide outside off, the batsman stretches out and slices a single down to third man."
"no run, length, angled across, shuffles across and blocks back."
"no run, full delivery outside off, the batsman fails to make contact. Another dot ball.."
"no run, back of a length on middle and leg, cramps the batsman for room, punched to midwicket."
"OUT, full outside off, and angling away from the batsman. Tries to lift it over cover, but slices it to the man on the circle. DK has crossed to the other side though!."
"OUT, has that been taken? Yes, Chris Gayle with a forward-diving catch. That's as rare a sight you'd see but it's true. Superb take as well. the batsman backed away and was looking to force a cut, but the back of room meant a thick outside edge, which is met by Gayle getting down and stooping low with both hands. They're going upstairs to check but he seems to have done alright. Yup, fingers underneath it. That should be out."
"1 run, shorter on off, and he backs away to pull it straight down the ground. Man at long on."
"no run, length, spins away, punched to cover."
"FOUR runs, 136 kph, it's full and wide again, may have been a wide had the batsman left that alone. the batsman swings, gives the ball everything he has. A thick outside edge flies over short third man.."
"no run, a yorker on off, jammed back to the bowler.."
"no run, excellent wide yorker, the batsman looks to carve this behind point but is late on the stroke."
"OUT, has that been dropped? Ok, wait, is that a runout? Yes, it is. Lots of things happened there. the batsman got a glove as he tried to pull this short ball and Pant drops it after diving to his left. Rayudu, in the meantime, has crossed over to the other end enthusiastically looking for a single only to find that the batsman hasn't so much as moved a toe. All he can do then is sprint back to his end but then the bowler nails a direct hit."
"FOUR runs, flat and powerful. Pitched right up to the batsman with the gift of room, and he shovels it straight over the bowler's head after freeing his arms."
"1 run, good length on middle, and it's the wrong'un to end the over. Angling into the batsman, who is forced to go towards the leg side, and punches to cover."
"FOUR runs, saved by an inside-edge that flies past Pant, who went the wrong way. This was a very thin one. the batsman is beaten for pace as he shapes to pull from outside off. Didn't miss the off stump by much.."
"no run, a low full toss outside off, smashed to deep cover. No run again. He just can't hit a boundary.."
"1 run, slower length ball outside off, eased down to third man."
"1 run, a short slower ball down leg, helped along to fine leg."
"SIX runs, he's not targeting the boundary - HE'S TARGETING THE BLEEPIN ROOF! Length ball. The absolute last thing you bowl to the batsman. And he clatters it straight down the ground.."
"no run, pushed through quicker and slides in to hit the thigh."
"1 run, starts with a full delivery and the batsman drives it down to long off."
"no run, good length outside off, and that's cut off the back foot to point."

"no run, back of a length, angled into him, backs away and swings across the line to get beaten."
"no run, leaves that alone as it turns a mile away from him."
"no run, good length on middle, and swings into the batsman. He tries to clip it square but misses the shot. Inside-edged onto his pads."
"no run, steps out to whip, got into a tangle as he played early because Axar slowed it down. Hit on the pad, manages to get back into the crease.."
"no run, good length on leg and the batsman's cramped for room this time. Tapped to cover off the back foot, but rather unconvincingly."
"1 wide, full outside off, and angling further away. the batsman's happy to shoulder his arms and collect the extra run."
"no run, full, and on off stump this time. Perfectly timed straight drive from the batsman, but the bowler gets his left hand to it. Parries it towards mid off."
"SIX runs, massive. A slower ball again from Hardik, it's right in the slot. Lofted cleanly and sweetly over long-on.."
"no run, good length outside off, and extra bounce forces the error from the batsman. Tried to cut but misses. Was that dropped?."
"1 run, very full and angling across off, pushed off the front foot wide of mid-off."
"1 bye, shapes to play the late cut, misses. DK fumbles and they scoot a bye."
"no run, beats the off stump! the batsman exposes the stumps and it looks like he's anticipating the ball to swing into him from an off stump line. Wants to drill it through cover, but this ball goes straight through with the angle."
"no run, non-turning back-of-a-length ball just a shade outside off, tapped to cover."
"FOUR runs, this time he paddles it past short fine leg. Went across a long way, looked to hit it to square leg but got an inside edge. Result doesn't matter. the batsman's back hand came off the grip as well.."
"OUT, he strikes! It was the slider, came down again but the ball was much flatter and shorter. Kishan runs down, and is nowhere near the pitch. That means the ball has enough room to turn, it finds a big gap between bat and pad to knock into the stumps.."
"1 run, slapped to point, where there's a misfield by Suryakumar. the batsman pinches a single to keep strike."
"SIX runs, the bowler, who? This is tremendous batting. A slower offcutter, the batsman picks it so early and like he does off the last ball, knows which shot he's going to play, a lofted drive over mid-off with soooo much ease."
"1 leg bye, a full and quick delivery down leg, the batsman is hurried for pace as he misses a flick, struck on the pad.."
"no run, full and slides in on middle, the batsman pokes the ball to cover."
"no run, low full toss on middle and leg, and the batsman smacks it straight down the ground. Well stopped by the bowler on his followthrough, who sticks his right hand out."
"SIX runs, that's a bad ball. You don't bowl a wide length ball like that to a batsman on fifty-odd in the penultimate over. A free swing of the arms as he smokes it way over long-on."
"no run, beaten by a googly, looked to dab this past short third with an angled bat."
"1 run, floats up a legbreak on middle and leg, clipped through midwicket."
"1 run,  Oh, dear. Maxwell! What have you done?  Will that prove to be the difference? Straight in, straight out at deep square leg. Avesh hits the deck hard again with this short ball, rushed onto the batsman as he pulled from outside off, got more elevation than distance. Maxwell came running in, trembled and never looked like taking it as it descended. Gosh!."
"1 run, whipped from outside off to midwicket off the back foot."
"1 run, swept yet again, Tahir has to run to his left from long leg and keeps it inside the boundary."
"OUT, there's the early wicket that Kings XI were looking for as the batsman's caught at short fine leg. A back-of-the-hand slower ball from Mohit and the batsman tries to whip it through the leg side. Gets the timing all wrong and skews it in the air off the leading edge."
"FOUR runs, full and wide outside off, smashed over cover for four. But doesn't do much to the crowd or Delhi's mood.."
"1 run, really full on off stump, smoothly driven down to wide long-on."
"no run, goes short outside leg, and DK wants to pull. He can't connect, and goes through to Kishan. What's surprising is the umpire doesn't call it a wide. the batsman is bemused."
"OUT, plumb! the batsman is gone! the bowler has put the fear truly into Wankhede now! It's a full ball on middle. the batsman plants the front leg across and tries to flick behind square. He's not good enough to do that. There is no doubt in this one."
"FOUR runs, pristine hit! The on the up drive works perfectly, showing how well this new ball is coming onto the bat. All the batsman does is open the face to beat cover on his right."
"1 run, looks to hoick this over midwicket but gets an inside edge that rolls to the off side. They sneak in a single."
"1 run, driven to long-on for a single.."
"SIX runs, This is more emphatic from the batsman and the Chinnaswamy roars in approval. Dragged down outside off, rocks back and nails a pull over midwicket. He sends it soaring into the stands."
"1 run, short, wide, makes the batsman reach out and he can't because of the injury, chops it into the surface. And that's fifty for the batsman."
"1 run, works this indrifter towards midwicket."
"1 run, drifts this into middle and leg, turned wide of midwicket."
"1 run, starts with a full-toss on off stump. Whipped down to long-on to bring Short on strike."
"SIX runs, Super the batsman! Short on middle, and he gets his front leg out of the way before swinging through the ball's line. Tonks it over cow corner for half-a-dozen."
"1 wide, awry from the bowler. Full, but pitched wide outside leg stump."
"no run, length outside off, punched on the front foot to extra cover."
"no run, goes through him! Umesh cranking it up and bowling short to the batsman even as he's making room to target the off side. This time the ball swings into him and he can't get any bat on that."
"no run, pitches it up outside his off-stump, the batsman reaches out for a drive to extra cover."

"1 run, charges down the track and drills it down to mid off for a quick single."
"2 runs, comes down and skews a drive to deep midwicket. Didn't quite get to the pitch of that. Two anyway.."
"FOUR runs, you beauty. the batsman with some aggressive sensibility! Shows the older boys how it's done. Stands his ground once again, allows the bowler to bowl to him and reacts to find a boundary through point. It's a poor ball - short and wide, and he carves it expertly."
"1 run, full and straight, worked away to deep midwicket for a run.."
"1 run, short of a length outside off, gets on the back foot and punches to sweeper cover."
"2 runs, the bowler bangs it short and outside off, the batsman can't get on top of it. Splices a pull over midwicket."
"2 runs, length ball angled in at middle stump. Slogs at it and gets it between deep square and deep midwicket off the inside half of the bat."
"no run, squeezes the drive to point."
"no run, looks to swat it away but he's beaten by pace. You won't spot any faces at Wankhede, they are all covered with nervous palms. Short of a length ""heavy ball"" outside off shoots past the attempted slog."
"FOUR runs, flat bats this full toss back over the bowler's head, long on comes around but Woakes can't get there. The season's highest individual score."
"1 run, good length on off and angling into him. Turned off his pads to deep midwicket on this occasion."
"1 run, the bowler tosses a legbreak outside off, the batsman reaches out and drives it to sweeper cover for a single. the batsman punches his fist, Dhoni keeps a poker face as usual. CSK go top."
"no run, a slower ball around off, 117 kph. the batsman punches to cover and calls for a non-existent single. Gayle tells him something along the lines of not quite a run there.."
"1 run, pulled into the gap, Duminy runs around from deep midwicket to cut that off.."
"SIX runs, full outside off, and the batsman makes room on the leg side. In the slot for him to free his arms, and the batsman sends it over deep extra cover! Comfortably lifted over cover."

"no run, the bowler lobs up a legbreak, dips on middle, tickled away to short fine leg off the inside half."

"2 runs, tries a reverse paddle, and gets it well past Dhoni despite not middling it too well."
"FOUR runs, the bowler ventures short and wide outside off, the batsman frees his arms and laces a cut to the left of short cover."
"no run, good length on off stump, and that's been flat-batted inside out. Straight to Jadeja at wide mid off, but it's been dropped! Soft, very soft. Wonder if he took it too casually."
"FOUR runs, sees this in his half and belts this over cover. Almost as if the batsman had decided he'd just look to blast this. Not quite to the pitch but he swung this through nicely.."
"1 wide, strays down leg for the third wide of the over. Sloppy.."
"OUT, the bowler bursts through the defences of the batsman with a sharp offbreak. Full, spins back in, dips at off stump, the batsman looks to run it down to third man from the stumps. He does not connect. the bowler hits the top of off and celebrates his second wicket."
"no run, good length on off stump, blocked on the front foot."
"no run, arm ball, the batsman stays leg-side of the ball and drills to cover."
"(no ball) 1 run, full on middle and off, jabbed down to long-off, and guess what, Curran's overstepped. But Kulkarni will be on strike for the free hit.."
"no run, gets down to paddle, may have got bat but it's well stopped, even if unintentionally,  by Pant, who offers his pad. He was moving to his left when the ball thudded into it. Lucky for the bowler."
"SIX runs, whoa, what a way to get off the mark. Length ball outside off, the batsman plants his front leg, extends his hands, and punches it up and over the wide long-on boundary."

"1 run, thick inside edge to a low full toss which he looks to whip through midwicket, down to fine leg instead.."
"1 run, looks to go over long-on, gets a thick inside edge onto the pad. Saha fires a wayward throw at the bowler's end and they get a single.  the batsman is applauded by the opponents as he walks off.  What entertainment.."

"no run, back of a length and outside off, slower one, the batsman delays his punch and hits it to cover."
"1 run, thumped inside out to deep extra cover.."
"1 run, OUT, and another! Well, scratch that about momentum. Three wickets in three balls. Two run outs. Quite appalling. It's a full toss and he lifts it inside-out to long-off's right. Jadeja picks up on the bounce. the batsman has settled into the crease at the non-striker's end. Negi is running down frantically though for some reason. Turns, slips, can't make his ground at the striker's end."
"1 run, short again, not so much width this time, pulled to deep midwicket."
"1 run, good length on middle, but angling across Curran. Carves it off the back foot to Mujeeb at deep point."

"1 run, picked off the pads to fine leg."
"1 bye, wild swing! But misses the batsman. Misses KL too. It was full outside off, and he tries to slog it over the bowler. the batsman looked for the release shot, but played it down the wrong line."

"1 run, back of a length on middle, the batsman slogs it in the air, lands in front of deep midwicket running in."

"SIX runs, he comes down and that lands into the crowd over long on! A bit of light, he absolutely middled that fearliesslly because long on was there and it sailed over him."

"1 run, starts with a flighted wrong'un, he does well to cover the stumps and get a thick edge to leg."

"1 wide, goes full and wide outside off. the batsman shuffles across to the off side but chooses not to play at it. The ump calls it as extras."
"FOUR runs, overpitched with a lot of room outside off. the batsman lives for this. Stays tall and drills it past extra cover."
"3 runs, hip-high full toss on leg stump, band that's been flicked off his pads to the backward square boundary. Not a no ball, but they still manage to take three. Delhi Daredevils finish on 163!."

"no run, good length on middle, and the batsman's trapped in his crease. Does well to defend it off the back foot."

"OUT, the googly goes through Nabi's wild heave. It pitched outside off, and turned back in. Nabi clears a front leg and swings, looking to clear midwicket, an indicator he read the variation. But the ball finds a massive gap between bat and pad to hit the stumps. Sunrisers now struggling.."

"1 run, half-tracker down leg, saved by Unadkat's fielding effort at deep square. the batsman cleared his front leg and absolutely walloped this pull. Should've been four, it's one instead.."

"2 runs, Manish Pandey with a brilliant effort to save a six. A wide fuller one that the batsman lofts over the in-field. Pandey at long-off snaffles it reverse-cupped, leans back as he does so, and is right in front of the boundary. He's falling over with the momentum and releases the ball as he's falling away.

"no run, another slower one, good comeback from the bowler this over. Defended to point."
"no run, that's much better. That's beautifully done, in fact. Draws him right forward by floating it up but makes sure to take it away from his off-stump, causing him to stretch forward and lose balance. Parthiv takes the bails off. Has the batsman slid the foot back in? Yes, he has."

"2 runs, excellent running effort to catch that at deep cover but it's jut out of his reach! the batsman didn't pick that googly, he miscued that with a leading edge and it went very high, Umesh ran a long way to his left, put in a dive but can't blame him for not taking that."
"1 run, short of a length outside off, slapped on the up to find sweeper cover."
"1 run, tossed up outside off, skies a slog-sweep over midwicket."
"1 leg bye, yorker on leg stump. Nicely bowled. De Villiers can't get this flick away. Cops it on the pad and it deflects into the off side."
"1 run, very full and angling wide of off, dragged off the inside half to the leg side."
"no run, slower ball, skids away rapidly off the pitch as the batsman it rooted to the crease chasing this with his hands. Doesn't get close to connection."
"FOUR runs, 115ks slower, back-of-a-length ball outside off, the batsman delays his punch and hits it past the left of mid-off and short cover for back-to-back fours."
"(no ball) 1 run, that's going to be a no-ball. Du Plessis pulls this high full toss into the hands of deep midwicket who doesn't have to move an inch. But that's well over waist height."
"OUT, soft dismissal! Good length outside off, and swinging away from the batsman. He tries to muscle this over the infield, but takes the top edge. Shakib - at cover - takes a few steps back and completes the catch from near his face. Bhuvi's knuckleball earns him a wicket."
"no run, works this flatter length ball to midwicket."
"no run, finishes with a legbreak on off, defended. Rashid walks away with outstanding figures of 4-0-13-1, including 18 dots."
"no run, beaten. A jab with an open face. Length ball outside off with some climb. He can't get bat as he tries to find the third man boundary."
"1 run, strays on the pads, worked away to deep square leg for a single.."
"no run, nice and full on the stumps, defended back with soft hands."
"1 wide, turns from middle and leg and goes down leg for a wide."
"1 wide, legbreak gone wrong, slips this down leg. Vijay sweeps and misses."
"no run, beaten on the outside edge. the batsman gets one slanted across his corridor and he jabs at it on the front foot."
"FOUR runs, deft. the bowler in panic mode. Looks for the arm ball but drops it very short and very wide. the batsman lets it come on and caresses it past cover point."
"no run, back of a length outside off, and seaming slightly away after pitching. the batsman tries to pull again, but that shot's been eluding him all evening. Goes over his bat and through to QDK."
"no run, tries to reverse sweep, but misses! Full outside off, and going straight through again. Low take by Buttler!."
"no run, and again. Fuller this time, and the batsman drives but Raina tumbles to his left again to stop it."
"1 run, OUT, too straight and worked into the gap at midwicket. The throw back to the bowler is good, he takes the bails off in a hurry and he thinks he has Christian. And he does. Christian is short of his crease. Sensational work from Agarwal at long-on. First, to run to his right and pick up with one hand, then releasing so quickly. And then, throwing the ball well despite being off balance. the bowler does the easier job of taking the bails off, but he did that very quickly too.."
"2 runs, swivel-pull but just about clears wide mid-on. Expensive, expensive over. the batsman didn't get hold of this pull as well as he would've liked.."
"no run, a swing and miss. Back of a length on off, or just wider. the batsman backs away and misses a drive. Just over the off stump.."
"no run, late on the stroke. Looked to use the pace and steer this behind point but is beaten.."
"SIX runs, down on one knee, and sent over midwicket! Tossed up on middle, and the batsman was quick to gauge the ball's length. Slog-sweeps it over the leg side and what a way to get to your first IPL fifty."
"1 run, good length on leg, and the punch towards the on-side takes a leading edge. Goes through towards cover."
"FOUR runs, good length, but wide outside off. DK simply sticks his bat out and ramps it just past the keeper's gloves. Minimal contact, and that helps him play it fine again."
"no run, defends this full delivery from the crease to midwicket."
"no run, length on leg stump, leans in and flicks straight to short midwicket."
"1 run, short of a length on leg stump, shovelled to deep midwicket off the back foot."
"1 run, good length outside off, and spinning away from the batsman. Carved off the front foot towards deep point."
"1 run, advances down the ground and whips a full toss to deep square leg."
"3 runs, good length just outside off, walks into it as it slants across the corridor and clips it through midwicket off the inside half of the bat. Rahane calls confidently for the third."
"SIX runs, he's clobbered this way over long-on. Is there life in the game? Too much flight, got underneath it and gave it some muscle."
"FOUR runs, tossed up on off, and the batsman tries an extravagant drive. Takes a thick outside edge, and loops over to short third man. Yusuf attempts a dive to his right, but the ball bounces in front of him and then races away to the boundary."
"no run, a good yorker on middle and leg, jammed back towards mid-off."
"1 run, full on the pads, hit down to long-on. Dhoni comes back for the second, but it may be one run short."
"no run, the flipper from the bowler, hurried on to beat him for pace, somehow managed to get some bat on it as he squeezed it out.."
"1 run, back of a length on the hips, swatted to deep midwicket."
"OUT, five-for, that's his career-best figures, and the best this season as well. Great work from the bowler, going full, going straight, giving very little leverage for the batsman. Nabi tries his best to launch it down the ground, but it only carries to long-off."
"1 run, gentle little tap into the off side as they scamper a quick single."
"1 run, full, angled across, driven to the left of sweeper cover."
"1 run, a legbreak on middle and leg, worked away with the spin to deep square leg for one."
"FOUR runs, past Gambhir's right this time at mid-off. No swing at all for the bowler. It's full outside off and a gentle loosener for Suryakumar to drive easily. Drilled.."
"SIX runs, picks the googly and then lets his hands do the rest. A wide googly, a ball that the bowler has owned recently. Lofted so easily over cover."
"1 run, slower ball at a length wide outside off. Reaches out and carts this off the toe-end to long-on."
"FOUR runs, hit over cover! A full and wide delivery at 118 kph., Kishan gets enough power behind the shot to hit the ball over cover for four.."
"no run, length ball at leg stump, exposes the stumps and sweeps as this spins towards him. Gets it straight to short fine."
"SIX runs, the batsman finally with the big hit. Whew! That was a long time coming. Rashid nicely floats this up outside the batsman's off-stump and he gets down on a knee to slog it over square leg for a massive six."
"no run, full just outside off. Rinku goes onto the front foot but defends this time."
"FOUR runs, brute force! And a fifty for the batsman, off 22 balls. That's as emphatic a franchise debut as there can be. A flighted fuller one on the stumps, and the batsman hammers it straight over."
"no run, low full toss on off stump. Almost a yorker, and he taps it back to the bowler. Fielded off the followthrough but the spectators celebrate the crowd catch instead."
"no run, too full and a bit of width as he floats it up outside off, the batsman jams the bat down and hits the turf."
"1 run, back of a length, runs down to third man with an open face."
"2 runs, drilled back down the ground, long-off comes around to cut that off. Shows the full face of the bat to hit this back, wow it just flew off the blade.."
"1 run, full but veering in from wide of the crease, Rohit is off balance as he looks to ramp this towards short fine. There's an appeal, but Rohit got some bat on it.."

"no run, back of a length outside off, plenty of zip and climb as the ball flies past the outside edge."

"no run, tossed up outside off, the batsman goes for the reverse-sweep and misses."
"1 run, a slower delivery outside off, carved to backward point for a run.."
"no run, looks to mow this across the line but swung through early and missed. Rolls to the keeper. Brushed the flap of the pad, I think.."
"FOUR runs, full on middle and leg, Dhawan is off balance as he squeezes the flick but somehow has managed to hit it well. Trickles into the short square leg boundary.."
"1 run, knocks it down to long-on."
"1 run, back of a length on top of off, punched down to long-off for one."
"1 run, full outside off, and that's been worked towards the leg side. No one's in the deep, so SRH finish with a boundary. Sunrisers win by seven wickets!."
"no run, great delivery. A wide yorker, making the batsman reach. With that sore back, it's asking him to do the impossible. Beaten."
"1 run, short of a length and spinning in at off stump. Gets deep in the crease and pushes through midwicket."
"FOUR runs, shoveled! Tremendous back-hand power as the batsman slams this slower back of a length delivery through long-off. Wouldn't have mattered if you had all your fielders there."
"OUT, the bowler has the batsman chopping his first ball onto the stumps. Back of a length and outside off, 142.3ks, the batsman throws his bat at the ball and aims to chop it away through point. Instead, the ball does not come on, takes the inside edge, and leaves the batsman's stumps in a mess."
"no run, wrong'un, pitching outside leg. the batsman picks it and reverse-sweeps, but straight to backward point."

"1 run, throws his hands at a fuller one outside off and drives uppishly to sweeper cover."
"1 run, full on middle and off, clipped off the pads to deep midwicket."
"FOUR runs, he's clobbered that with immense power. Runs down, gets close enough to the bowler's offcutter and then smashes the ball over mid-off. Muscular hit.."
"1 run, enough room outside off to drive that powerfully along the ground through the covers."
"no run, low full toss on off stump, but tailing sharply into DK's toes. Tries to play straight, but the swing forces an error from the batsman. He bottom-edges it to the keeper. Could've easily chopped onto his stumps however."
"OUT, he's done him with a slider again. There's some drift back in. the batsman goes back to pull but is beaten by this 90kph delivery that goes straight on to beat his attempted whip and crash into the stumps.."
"no run, flicks this full toss on middle to midwicket."
"no run, that's much tighter. A short of a length delivery around off, Suryakumar jabs it back to the bowler from the crease."
"OUT, slower length ball, the batsman gets across and sweeps this straight to Umesh at backward square leg. Big wicket under the circumstances. Made him fetch this, because he changed the pace, this bounced that much more to hit the top part of the bat to deny him the power to clear the infield.."
"1 run, tries to reverse sweep, but checks his shot. Full on leg stump, forcing the batsman to pull out of the shot. Still manages to play it towards the right-hander's cover area."
"SIX runs, the good old the batsman mow, and he's cleared deep midwicket effortlessly. Just a touch full and in his swinging arc. Easy for the batsman."
"1 run, good length on middle stump, worked towards the leg side."
"no run, full outside off, but sharp spin into his pads. Misses the defense and big appeal for lbw. Turned down though. Spinning too much, I think."
"1 run, back of a length outside off, and easily thumped down the ground to long off for a walking single. You'd think the batsman would be happy to get off strike."
"1 run, Three fielders, including the bowler, converge but the ball drops in between them. Tossed up and spins away outside off, the ball turns in the batsman's hands as he skews it over the bowler's head. Yuvraj runs in from long-off, can't get there. Axar runs back, can't get there either. The ball was far away from the other fielder."
"no run, floated up on off, presses forward and works to midwicket."
"1 run, fullish length, angled in towards middle and off, drilled to long-on."
"SIX runs, gets fifty with a six! Half-tracker on off, and the batsman muscles this over long on. Stokes was getting under it, but the ball was simply too high."
"no run, back of a length outside off, gets big on the batsman, as he chops it down to third man."
"OUT, edged to the keeper, KKR collapsing on their home ground against seam bowling. the bowler leaps in celebration and why shouldn't he. That one pitched around the leg stump and the bowler angled it nicely to absolutely stifle the batsman with the line and he only tickled it to the keeper."
"no run, another slower ball, knuckle ball, 109ks, another swing and a miss."
"1 run, short of a length and in at middle. Stands tall and nudges it to mid-on with soft hands."

"1 run, another legbreak, full on middle and leg, nudged to square leg."
"no run, chopped from off stump to cover."
"SIX runs, lovely shot. Waits for that flight to dip and not turn. the batsman then swats the sweep over long-on with sublime timing, it was close to a cross bat but the power and timing was excellent.."
"no run, full and wide outside off, big stride forward but the drive's been mistimed."
"1 run, super slow, but short outside off. KW has to wait ages, before swiping it from over his head and to the man at deep midwicket."
"OUT, Mustafiz pockets a one-handed return catch. This was a Mustafiz special: cutter, skipping away outside off, the batsman chips a leading edge to the left of the bowler. Mustafiz stretches out his left hand and comes out with the ball. Mumbai edge ahead."
"1 run, short of a length on off stump, punched to long-off off the back foot."
"no run, fullish length, angled across off, drilled hard into the covers."

"no run, back of a length on middle and leg, the bowler gets it to straighten, defended."
"SIX runs, right into the batsman's swinging arc and he's walloped this over deep midwicket. Saw the batsman backing away, and tried to cramp him but ended up straying on the pads. the batsman didn't miss out.."
"FOUR runs, thick outside edge as he attempts to slash over point, but this one flies over Buttler's outstretched hands behind the stumps. Streaky boundary."
"no run, misses again! Looks to go leg side again. Short of a length ball outside off and it's too quick again. There are gaps over extra cover and mid-off, but he's aiming midwicket right now."
"no run, shortish, angled across off, the batsman jumps and blocks."
"SIX runs, ah, super strike that! Walloped into the deep backward square leg fence. Too full, too straight and down leg, the batsman just walloped it away. Bread and butter stroke for him."
"OUT, steps out and heaves this straight down Cutting's throat at long-on. Hardik's slower deliveries are yielding returns for Mumbai at the death.."
"1 run, the cutter again, and this time it's short outside off. Mistimes this slapshot to cover, and Anureet stops the ball with a one-handed slider! Excellent commitment in the field."

"1 run, length ball, drifts it in towards off, drilled into the leg side off the inside of the bat."
"no run, good length outside off, but sharply spins inwards. the batsman mistimes his punch back to the bowler."
"1 wide, short on leg stump, and too high. the batsman doesn't even duck and that's flown over his helmet."
"1 run, fuller on leg stump, and the batsman gets his toes out of the way before driving to the man at long on. Moves on to 48."
"FOUR runs, good length outside off, and angling into the batsman. Stays on the back foot, and glances this past short third man. Beats the infield, and no stopping that thereafter!."
"no run, full and curving in on off, driven to short cover."
"FOUR runs, back of a length, sitting up nicely outside off. Was the slower one from the bowler, and the batsman rocks back and crunches a pull over midwicket."
"SIX runs, chance goes down! Difficult but Manish Pandey's effort goes for a six. Full on off, and he lifts it over mid on. Pandey - at long on - gets under it, and even sticks his hand out. The ball stays in his palm, but his momentum's taking him over the boundary. Still manages to throw the ball in the air, but his inertia forces the ball to land beyond the boundary anyway."
"1 run, short and in the corridor. Gets behind and dabs it to third man's left."
"1 run, slightly shorter, around off, pulled to deep midwicket, one.."
"1 wide, yorker-length on the pads, Dhawan overbalanced as he misses. Poor call from umpire Virender Sharma. Flicked the pad.."
"FOUR runs, pure timing, pure pace. There's width on this short delivery, the batsman stays back inside the crease and then steers this behind point.."
"no run, goes for the drive on the up - a dangerous shot on a bouncy pitch. Finds cover."
"no run, a slower offcutter on middle, defended to cover. A very good comeback from the bowler."

"SIX runs, at the moment, he's dealing in just sixes. This slower ball is bowled at length, the batsman backs away and lofts this through the line to clear long on."

"no run, looks to run this down but is beaten by the away-going length ball."

"no run, back of a length and outside off, the batsman can't connect with a little dab to third man."

"1 leg bye, through with the pull too early, hits the shoulder and rolls to the keeper, they scamper a leg bye."
"1 run, works this low full toss down to long on."
"2 runs, that's another mistake from Sran. He's having a shocker. Short and wide outside off, slapped to wide long-off. Finch returns the throw at the bowler's end, at an awkward height. He misses the collection with Iyer well outside his crease. Big error.."
"no run, yorker on off stump, and that's been dug back to the bowler. He's forced to stick his hand up and the ball sticks! Excellent over."
"1 run, good length outside off, and sharp legspin. Tries to slog-sweep, but top-edges it towards the leg side. Falls short of deep midwicket."
"1 run, back of a length on off and angling away from Yusuf. Tries to cut hard at it, but straight to Yuvraj at cover point. But it pops straight out. What a rare drop from Yuvraj."
"no run, pitches this one leg stump, the batsman tries the reverse sweep and misses it completely. That wasn't far from the leg stump."

"no run, full delivery angling into middle and leg, struck on the pad as he shapes to work this across the line."
"no run, hint of turn outside off, dabbed to point."
"OUT, taken. the batsman picks out backward point. Another wide yorker, the batsman gets underneath the length but all he successfully does is chip a slice to the fielder. A comfortable reverse-cupped catch.."
"FOUR runs, gloriously punched through the covers. Back of a length and outside off, he stays leg-side of the ball and stylishly hits it in the gap."
"1 run, full on leg stump, and that's been nudged to the vacant mid-wicket region. Allows them an easy single."

"no run, around the off stump and the batsman pushes it into the covers."

"no run, pitched up around off, the batsman comes forward and drives it back."
"1 run, punches a back of a length delivery to long-off."

"1 wide, back of a length and slanting away wide outside off, past the reach of the batsman, off-side wide."
"FOUR runs, hoicked away again, the midwicket boundary has been peppered again. Take that, he says. the batsman has come out looking to play a different game."
"2 runs, good length on off, but once again legspin from the bowler. the batsman stays on the back foot and drags a shot towards cow corner. Two men in the deep, and one of them cut it off."
"1 leg bye, and they concede the leg bye eventually! A full delivery down leg, the batsman looks for the paddle scoop. The ball hits the pad to fine leg. the batsman sends Iyer back, the throw is to the non-striker's end. the bowler doesn't bother colecting the throw and so concedes an extra."

"1 run, slides in on middle and leg, no turn, punched off the front foot through midwicket."

"5 runs, overpitched outside off, and that's been drilled to McCullum at mid off. Could be a run out, but it's not a direct hit! Oh dear, no one's backing up either. Chahal and Siraj try hard to stop the ball near the boundary, but it's a futile attempt by both men. Free runs for Mumbai to end the Powerplay."

"1 run, good length just outside off, and he punches down the ground to long off."
"FOUR runs, bit too full on middle and leg and the batsman flicks it away almost nonchalantly over midwicket for a cracking four. Excellent timing."

"SIX runs, back of a length and outside off, 129kph, slower one from the bowler. the batsman picks the legcutter, stands still, and short-arms it over the midwicket boundary. That back is fine. If it isn't, then the hands are great."

"1 run, nurdled through square leg for one."

"1 run, drifts in a slider towards middle and leg, worked towards deep square leg."
"1 run, full on middle stump, and driven with the turn to long off. They walk across to collect a single."

"FOUR runs, leg-side fuller ball, too easy for Parthiv as he gets down on the back knee and sweeps it through deep square leg. The fielder is stationed slightly backward and he can't get around it."

"1 run, length, leg-side line, tucked to short fine leg."
"1 run, gentle little dab into the off side for a quick single."

"1 wide, too full and drifting down the leg side."
"1 run, whipped from outside off to long-on. Lovely wristwork from the batsman."
"1 leg bye, slower bouncer - and it's very well executed too. the batsman spots the length early but not the change in pace. He's into the pull shot and though he tries to adjust his bat swing, he misses the ball and it goes off his body towards point."
"1 run, good length on off and angling into KW. Turned off his pads to deep midwicket. Gets off the mark."
"1 run, back of a length on off, but sticks with the slower ball again. Mistimes his pull to the man in the deep this time."
"1 wide, 139 kph, an excellent wide yorker outside off. The ball creeps under the bat. Called a wide, quite harshly.."
"FOUR runs, this is not the ideal length to be bowling at all. Too short, and so much width on offer. the batsman waits and then jumps before slashing a late uppercut through third man."
"no run, slower ball, on off stump. the batsman's forced to check his attempted drive, and taps it with soft hands to point instead. Wants the single, but eventually chooses not to. Smart choice."
"1 run, slower ball, on off stump. It's angling across his body, but the batsman's leg-side heave is mistimed. Goes to long off instead."
"(no ball) 1 run, oh, dear. Oversteps as he bowls this full delivery that is defended back. Huge roar around the ground as the umpire calls it a  freehit ."
"1 run, a full delivery on off, punched to long-off."
"1 run, shortish delivery angling in towards leg stump, whipped towards deep midwicket."
"2 runs, chips it wide of midwicket and deep square leg cleans up to his left. It's a bouncer at chest height and he gets under it on the hook."
"no run, looks for the switch hit, but he gets just enough bat to short third man. Flat and wide outside off, helped along.."
"no run, back of a length and zips in on middle, this wrong'un is played back to the bowler.."
"OUT, run out at the non-striker's end! Full and wide outside off again, and the batsman can't muscle this over cover either. Gowtham's quick to get to the other end, but the batsman's too slow. Rajasthan need 10 off two balls."
"no run, 144kph, waits for the good length ball on leg stump and turns it to square leg.."
"OUT, finally flighted one, got it to turn and has been rewarded. This is much slower through the air, the batsman is drawn forward as he shapes to drive but couldn't get to the pitch. The faint nick has been well taken by Rahul behind the stumps.."
"FOUR runs, a thick outside edge races away through third man! Another cutter, it actually cuts off the pitch. Takes the outside edge and flies to the third man boundary."
"1 wide, short and spinning away, far too wide on the googly. Left alone."
"1 run, good length on middle, and fended off the front foot. the batsman went to the leg side but the bowler's delivery angle followed him. Rana wanted the single, but the batsman wasn't sure. They complete it eventually."
"OUT, full on off, right in the swinging arc, but the batsman does not get all of it. He miscues a loft to Kohli at the long-off region. The RCB captain moved to his left from long-on and pouched it in front of AB at long-off. the batsman got it off the toe end, giving Kohli catching practice."
"no run, back of a length and angling away outside off, the batsman seeks to run it down to third man. No dice. Beaten."

"no run, tossed up on middle and leg. DK chooses to defend off the front foot."

"1 run, back of a length and spins away outside off, skewed off to the leg side."
"no run, tries to find the gap again with a back-foot cut and finds point this time."
"1 run, nicely bowled, some flight around off, swept down to short fine leg for one.."

"1 run, good length outside off again, and spinning away from the batsman once more. Opens his bat's face and plays it towards cover point. Gap there to exploit."

"FOUR runs, short of a length outside off, the batsman doesn't entirely get behind the line this time and doesn't middle it. Whipped away off the inside of the bat through square leg."

"1 run, good length just outside off, and going straight through. Tapped towards cover off the back foot. Tiwary stops."
"FOUR runs, drags it one-handed to deep square's right. He's done by the slower short ball, but the typical elongated hands as he looks to pull means he has a chance yet. Uses that left hand to place this."
"no run, full, wide of the crease, slanting in, the batsman plays around his front pad and pushes to mid-on."
"FOUR runs, angled in and the batsman helps it with the wrists off his hips to the long leg boundary and that's his fifty."

"FOUR runs, 142.3ks swinging full-toss on off stump, the bowler searches for the yorker but overpitches it. the batsman stays still and belts it past the left of the bowler and right of mid-off. So easy on the eye ."
"FOUR runs, the bowler continues the trend of horrible deliveries, a full toss on leg stump, and the batsman flicks it to deep midwicket."

"1 run, full and angling in on middle, whipped out to deep midwicket."
"no run, good length outside off, but nice swing into the batsman. Defends it off the front foot to cover."

"SIX runs, dug in short and outside off, the batsman shuffles across off, and unleashes a pull. Sails over the fine leg fielder."
"SIX runs, that's perhaps the biggest of the night. A full toss outside off, the batsman whips it with powerful wrists and sends it soaring over backward square leg. Way, way back into the stands. Also ruins what had been a good over for Daredevils."
"FOUR runs, swept from outside off, picks the gap at deep square leg.  Half-century for the captain and what a time to do so.  Brave. Shardul went full, Rohit could've used the pace to go behind point but preferred the leg side because he was well aware."
"SIX runs, gets to the pitch of the ball and clobbers this over wide long-on. Got so close, so it didn't matter if the delivery was a legspinner or a googly. Stunning blow, pure muscle.."

"1 run, goes back and across as he punches this short ball to sweeper cover."
"no run, hurried for pace? 142 kph, back of a length outside off. the batsman wants to pull but is nowhere near the shot. The ball splices to mid-on, doesn't carry."

"OUT, caught at the boundary! D'Arcy Short snaffles a smart catch at deep midwicket. A length ball around middle, Axar tries to loft it over the leg side but is done in by the lack of room.

"1 run, stays back in the crease and bunts it down to long on."
"1 run, full on off, but turned off his pads towards midwicket. They collect the single on offer."

"no run, beaten by the dip and turn, slices the drive on the bounce to point."
"SIX runs, pulled, and pulled very very well. What a flourish, what a finish. Sitting up nicely as the batsman muscled this over deep midwicket.  KKR will have to bat out of their skins to get this.  22 off the last over, not the finish they wanted.."

"no run, good length just outside off, tapped towards mid-off on the up."
"1 run, back of a length, punched down to long-on."
"2 runs, full, but outside leg stump. the batsman was already down the ground, so all he needs to do is clip it off his toes. Played to fine leg."

"1 run, full on middle stump, flicked to mid-on."
"no run, beaut! A leg spinner's dream ball. Drifts and lands on leg stump, and then turns across the batsman's bat. Taken by Buttler from outside off."
"FOUR runs, dropped at deep backward square! And goes for four. Another low full toss on middle, and that's been whipped off his pads. Duminy got under it, but messes it all up. The ball pops out, takes a bounce, and then goes for four. Kolkata need 23 off the final over."
"2 runs, back of a length, just punches from the crease and picks the gap nicely at cover."
"no run, big appeal for lbw! But turned down. the bowler wants to review. It was a good-length ball on middle, and zipped straight through. the batsman tried to defend but the ball sneaked between bat and pad. Impact's in front of middle stump, but would that have hit the stumps? the batsman's big stride may have saved him. Yep, missing middle stump. Too high, so KKR lose their review."
"1 run, backs away and drills this low full toss to sweeper cover."
"1 run, short of a length just outside off, nudged past cover off the back foot."

"1 run, good length on off, goes onto the back foot, and carves it square to the man in the deep."

"no run, drifting down leg, paddled fine but straight to short fine leg."
"no run, shapes to pull but the ball skids back in to hit the flap of the pad as the batsman is through with the stroke early. That was bowled at 103kph."
"OUT, Such fast hands from Dhoni. Kohli and the batsman gone in two overs. the bowler tosses up an offbreak on middle, turns in, the batsman stretches out for a reverse-sweep but still can't meet the pitch of the ball.

"no run, short at the body, fended off."

"FOUR runs, attempted yorker is pitching well outside leg. Reaches out and tickles this fine. The fielder makes it to the ball but the slide is not quick enough."

"1 run, a slower ball outside off, tapped towards point for a run."

"no run, the googly! De Kock does not pick that! The googly outside off, the batsman plays for some legspin but the ball keeps drifting on and beats the bat."

"OUT, Umesh floors the off stump with a 141.1kph rocket. Follows the short ball with a full one. the batsman hangs back, then ventures outside the leg stump and searches for a drive.

"1 wide, drifts it in down the leg side again."
"no run, full, spins back in from off stump, defended back."
"1 run, in the air and Bravo makes no attempt. Another top-edge on the sweep and Bravo runs forward before bailing off in the last minute. Misjudgement."
"no run, dropped by Jadeja again! the batsman is a cat! How many lives?! Back of a length on middle, and this inside out slap comes off the bat's top half again. But Jadeja can't hold on to it after bending backwards to reach at this high ball. Hits his palm and pops out."

"1 run, back of a length outside off, and the batsman whips it towards midwicket off the back foot."

"no run, length ball at off stump, pushes it to point off the front foot."

"1 run, slower full ball at 129.7ks on leg stump, pushed away between mid-on and midwicket."
"OUT, in the block hole, that's plumb! What a reply from Harshal. the batsman went back and across early to cover the stumps and steer it to the leg side, and Harshal sends down a slow offcutter with some revs, the batsman misjudges the pace completely and is trapped right in front."

Because the batsman saw the length, picked the right shot (a wild T20 heave, what else?) but was through his shot too early. The ball then had an unhindered path to the middle stump. Lovely execution.."

"FOUR runs, on a length and outside off, the batsman drives it on the up and creams it away to the cover boundary."

"2 runs, drifts in a full delivery towards the pads, tucked towards deep square."

"2 runs, full and outside off, the batsman slams it to deep cover and they pinch a couple again. This is super work from Kings XI, assuming Stoinis has stretched far enough to make his ground at the non-strikers. And he has. This is a small ground, people, and these guys are absolutely stealing doubles.."
"FOUR runs, plants his foot across and paddles it fine against the turn and it's gone really fine to beat the fielder."

"no run, width offered again, but this time Suryakumar can't time it well. Too wide, actually, and therefore his cut finds the bat's toe end. Krishna will feel relieved ."

"2 runs, taps it behind square leg and pinches a couple as well. Good work from the batsman. Plays with soft hands and had a partner who was willing to put in a little extra effort. Karnataka boys going well.."

"1 leg bye, floated up at the pads, deflected to the leg side. Ashwin gets the strike."

"1 run, looks to wallop this over deep midwicket, gets a thick inside edge and can only get it as far as square leg."
"OUT, 101ks slower ball, dips outside off, the batsman does not pick the change-up. He swishes so hard that he loses his shape and under-edges it back to DK behind the stumps. They search for a single but Maxwell is sent back. The keeper passes the ball to Mavi, who clips the top of the bails with an over-arm throw."
"SIX runs, over long on! And CSK complete another heist. Full on middle stump, but the batsman gets his front foot out of the way to smack this over the bowler's head.

"OUT, Axar has been pinned in front. Umpire Ravi raises his finger almost immediately. Full and angled in from over the wicket, Axar is caught on the crease. He plays around his front pad and is struck on it below the knee-roll. It would crash into leg stump. Axar walks off."
"no run, gets down for a reverse sweep and misses to get hit on the pad. Given out almost instantly but the batsman reviews. The impact could have been outside off. Spins in a little but this could just be umpire's call on impact. Nope, it's just outside, so overturned."
"1 run, dabs this gently into the off side for a quick single."
"OUT, the bowler strikes again, and it's another golden duck for the batsman! Or is it? the batsman reviews. But this was a poor shot from the batsman. Pays the price for playing against the turn.

"1 run, back of a length on the hips, the batsman stands tall and forces it down to long-on."

"OUT, Rana leaps to his left and holds on. the batsman stuck in a strange position for the late cut. It's a short ball just outside off. It looks like he changes his mind on the late cut very late and wants to just defend it. In the end, hangs the bat out and it's a sharp catch."

"1 run, OUT, overpitched and outside off, the batsman stays beside the line and drills it down to long-off. the batsman wants two, the throw is to the bowler, who gathers it and takes the bails off. Binny stretches, but is caught short by an accurate throw from his Karnataka team-mate."

"1 run, back of a length on leg stump, and the batsman punches it towards midwicket. He'll keep strike."

It's pitched outside off and come in not too bad on line. But it won't matter - it has got a bit of the inside edge. The review is lost.."

The TV umpire has multiple slow-mo replays to look at it. Eventually decides it's a six. Top shot."

"SIX runs, pumps it down the ground! This is a back of a length ball. And he unleashes a front foot lofted drive. That's tough to pull off.

Mujeeb continues to have a field day."

"OUT, big appeal! And that's the slow finger of death. He's reviewing, but looks half-hearted. Was short on middle, and the batsman just couldn't connect with the pull. The ball snuck under his bat, and hit his back leg. Looks kinda high though. Could miss the stumps, but alas! Would've clipped top of middle stump.."
"1 run, length ball pushed through flat at middle stump. Nudged through midwicket from the crease."
"no run, another shot to the same fielder but the intent was a lot different on this occasion. He reached out to a widish length ball and threw hard hands looking to force it through the off side."
"1 run, unleashes a late cut at this short and wide delivery and Raina at point half-stops it with a big dive to his left."
"1 run, drives on the up and gets an outside edge away to third man."
"1 run, on the pads this time as the batsman flicks to backward square leg and slips in his hurry to get back for the second. Has to settle for one."

"1 run, back of a length on off, the batsman allows the ball to come onto him, then lets it slide off the face to Rayudu at short third man."
"no run, that's at top pace, at 132 kph, and it's dug into the middle of the pitch. the batsman thinks about flat-batting it, but it gains too much height. Zips past his nose."
"no run, slower ball, wide outside off. DK winds up to hit it straight, but the pace (or lack of it) does him in. Under edges it to Kishan. Hardik asks him to hold on to the ball."
"1 run, sliced over the infield, down to deep point."
"OUT, Base of middle Thampi seals the game! The simplest way to knock over the tailender. Go full, go straight, watch him flop around like mad and knock the stumps over. the batsman goes for the scoop, so he probably expected the fuller ball, just couldn't come out the right side of the gamble."
"1 run, chopped away to deep point."
"no run, full and slow, flicks early and lobs it slightly towards midwicket."
"1 run, short and turning into the body. Punches to long-on off the back footsh."
"SIX runs, on a length and outside off, but Faf had jumped across off even before the bowler had delivered. Merrily scooped away fine of short fine leg. ."
"1 wide, bouncer dug in too short and wide outside off. Sails past the bat as he looks to hook."
"SIX runs, floated up outside off, meets the pitch with a big stride across and slogs it against the spin from outside off. Clean over deep midwicket. Top shot."
"no run, another dot to the batsman, flat down leg. the batsman misses a flick, struck on the pad.."
"1 run, slower delivery on leg stump, turned towards square leg."
"no run, looking for another big hit but can't connect, hit away with bad timing to midwicket."
"no run, the googly, picks him well. the batsman backs away, reads the googly and defends. Two dots in three balls.."
"no run, Dhawan gets one on the knee cap. Can't catch a break! Length ball slanting in from outside off. Gets on the front foot and looks to drive and gets an inside edge that misses the flap on the lunged back knee. Treatment time ice treatment. Followed by some mobility exercises.."
"1 run, good length, drifts in on middle, sticks in the pitch, the batsman spoons it in the air but to the right of short cover."
"no run, a length ball that slides in and hits the batsman in front of leg as he misses the flick."
"1 run, back of a length on off stump, punched to sweeper cover."
"no run, gets down to a reverse sweep but to the wrong length. It's a length ball outside off and the ball sneaks past."
"no run, shuffles across early and tries to tuck this back of a length delivery but gets an inside edge into the pad before it rolls away into the off side."
"1 run, another googly, shorter this time. the batsman has plenty of time to wait on the back foot and punch to long-off."
"no run, drills this to mid-off, Rohit wanted the single but was sent back."
"1 run, back of a length, punched to sweeper cover."
"OUT, the slower one, 113 kph, the ball pitches and swerves away. the batsman backs away and swings himself off his feet almost. Some floaty, swervy bowling, maybe the knuckle ball? A thick outside edge is easily taken by Buttler. This has been a terrific over from the bowler.."
"no run, back of a length outside off, pushed to cover point."
"1 run, another slider, on middle and leg, pushed to mid-on."
"FOUR runs, full and wide, a poor ball. Slashed over backward point with fierce power. A brief counter-attack and KKR back in front.."

"no run, full and angling across off, the batsman pokes it back to the bowler."
"no run, tossed up outside leg stump, and the batsman tries to slog it towards the leg side. Can't hit it though as the ball comes off his front leg."
"1 run, moves back and across again, but this time, the bowler does better, pitching the ball up, but not so far that it is a half-volley. With nothing to get under, and no room to work with, he mis-hits to short fine leg."
"no run, much better. A length ball that's angled across and straightens around the fourth or fifth-stump channel, left alone."
"OUT, did he misjudge that? He did, but he still took the catch at short fine leg. the bowler has his maiden IPL wicket. An offcutter around off, the batsman tries to scoop the ball over short fine leg, but the ball hits the top third of the bat, more towards the splice. The ball carries low to Avesh at short fine leg, he dives in front and takes a good, low catch.."
"FOUR runs, very poor from the bowler. Too short and angling down, Dhawan helps this down past short fine leg. He'll put those away in his sleep. Not the kind of ball you want to be bowling to someone who has a highest of 11 in his last five innings!."
"1 run, whips this one with the wrists towards mid on."
"1 run, works it away into the leg side for one."
"1 run, back of a length, nips away outside off, dropped into cover for one."

"1 leg bye, full on leg stump, and the batsman misses the on-drive. Hits his back leg and dribbles away towards short fine leg."
"no run, ANOTHER BOUNCER! Just under the shoulder, deems the square leg umpire. It's another short delivery that hurries the batsman through the shot. Beaten."
"SIX runs, slog sweep! Full on off, and the batsman takes a big stride forward to get down on one knee. Simply swings through the legside thereafter."
"no run, punches this straight to Curran at cover point."
"1 run, length ball slanted in at leg stump. Leans in and clips uppishly to deep square's left."

"1 run, on a length down leg, nudged down to fine leg for one.."
"no run, a shortish delivery outside off, 127 kph. the batsman lets that one go."
"2 runs, cleverly works this down to long on, they hare back for the second. Very risky, you have to say. Thankfully a positive response from Pant."
"SIX runs, tournament's best bowler: take that. the batsman has walloped this length ball into the change rooms at deep midwicket. Clean, clean strike. Superb picking of length, hit the middle of the bat. Sailed away. Wow."
"no run, full on off, and the batsman attempts the reverse sweep. Mistimed to point. Excellent start to the second over from Axar."
"1 run, full on off, and the batsman backs away to muscle it towards deep midwicket. Gets off the mark."
"no run, nearly sneaked through the gap between bat and pad. Looked to work to the leg side but played outside the line.  Saved by a thin inside edge ."
"1 run, slower fullish ball, punched to sweeper cover."
"SIX runs, Hit flat and hard for a six! Back of a length and much wider outside off, the batsman extends his hands and scythes it up and over the covers. Dismissive. Shot of a man who's coming off a fastest fifty in the IPL."
"no run, nicely bowled on the stumps, around middle and leg and it turned enough to make the batsman defend it back. No room whatsoever."
"SIX runs, into the open sky and into the stands! Pitched up slightly in the batsman's arc, he picked the length and smoked it over long on. Hit it so hard, I wouldn't have tried to catch it."
"no run, googly, knocked back to the bowler from off stump."
"2 runs, full, leg-side line, flicked to square leg."
"no run, full and slides on off stump, no turn, the batsman hangs back and pokes the ball to point."

"1 run, quicker ball, and flat on leg stump. Clipped off his pads to fine leg."
"1 run, chops this into the square third man region. the batsman backed away to slap this through point."
"no run, looking for the gap either side of short third man, but he finds the fielder! Full and wide, dabbed away towards short third man.."
"FOUR runs,  dropped at slip!  Is that the game? Williamson lets this go through his hands. This was a thick outside edge as the batsman jabbed at this. What's worse? It races away to the third man boundary."
"1 run, really full and outside off, squeezed to the covers."
"4 leg byes, brushes the thigh pad and beats the diving Saha down leg. A short of length delivery but pitched way down leg. the batsman looked to work it fine, but will take runs however they come.."
"1 run, googly but this is tossed up way outside leg, turned to deep square."

"no run, full just outside off, the batsman backs away and carves it towards point."
"1 run, almost a yorker outside off, and Hardik does well to dig it out. The ball's going towards Krunal, and the bowler can't field it despite the effort."
"OUT, takes the catch! A slower ball on leg, the batsman bunts the ball away again to long-on. Stokes runs in and takes a simple catch to seal Delhi's fate. A match-changing 10 balls from the bowler.."
"no run, flatter and fuller on middle and leg, pushed into the vacant midwicket region but the bowler sprints across to save the single."
"OUT, a slower delivery on middle and leg, and the batsman picks out long-on! And it's taken! Juust. the bowler is having a terrific debut. the batsman looked to whip that slower cutter through midwicket but got that too straight. Iyer runs across from his right and pouches the catch after juggling.."
"SIX runs, full-toss on middle stump, the bowler isn't getting his lengths right. the batsman sizes it up and smites it over midwicket for back-to-back boundaries. Deejay the batsman is having CSK fans grooving to his tunes."
"FOUR runs, and the batsman welcomes him with four. Overpitched and outside off, clears his front leg and thrashes it through the covers."
"1 run, steps out and mistimes this flat-batted hit down to long on."
"FOUR runs, good length outside off, and once again played delicately! Stays on the back foot and opens his bat's face to play the cut between backward point and short third man. Deft from the batsman.."
"no run, plays and misses a full toss outside off.."
"1 run, steps out and belts this length ball to long on."
"1 run, full on off, and the drive's been crunched to Rana at cover point. Stopped well, but his throw doesn't hit the stumps. Allows them to take an overthrow."

"2 runs, rolls his fingers over the ball, so takes the pace off. Good length outside off, and comfortably punched to wide long off for a couple."

"1 run, good length on off, and the ball stays low this time! Pulled along the ground to the man in the deep."
"no run, Suryakumar the batsman backs away outside leg, the bowler runs in hard, hits the pitch harder and finds extra bounce to zip past the bat."
"FOUR runs, oh glorious. Give us eleven of this guy. Hangs on the back foot to this length ball outside off and opens the face late to drive this between point and cover. Neither of them had a chance."
"SIX runs, for most parts, this was a mistimed pull, but well, it still cleared long on by a distance. I was looking mid on, but it just kept going, going ..."
"3 runs, this time he pulls, doesn't get hold of it as well as he would've liked but will take three as Finch gives it a laboured chase from mid on."
"no run, full and fast outside off. the batsman can't make any connection. A useful dot to end the bowler's spell."
"1 wide, full, slow and sliding down leg.  the batsman tries a flick. Doesn't come off."
"2 runs, just misses the stumps as the batsman goes on the back foot again. It's an inside edge that trickles past the stumps. De Kock then runs in and takes aim at the non-striker's stumps. Hits the stumps too but the batsman is safe, as the replays confirm. He's also come back for a second."
"1 run, back of a length on middle stump. the batsman stays on the back foot and punches it past the bowler's left. Man at long on though."
"1 wide, starts with a wide. Full and very wide, looking for the tramline but just errs.."
"1 run, slower full one, driven to long-off."
"FOUR runs, muscled! One bounce and this bisects deep midwicket and long on. Proper baseball slog. Cleared the front leg and boom!."

"SIX runs, right in the slot outside off and the batsman monsters it over midwicket. A-grade hitting."
"no run, full on middle and leg, the batsman nudges it to a short leg that Royals have put in place. Rahane knows he needs wickets.."
"no run, full outside off, pushed away to cover. His feet are nowhere.."
"no run, another short delivery, this is under the shoulder though. the batsman misses an upper cut.."

"2 runs, steps out and forces this fuller delivery into the gap at wide long off."
"1 wide, bouncer lifting sharply just outside leg stump. Late on the hook. Karthik (and me) think there's a sound there. Umpire has his arms spread to signal wide."
"no run, cramps him with a full delivery on middle, from around the wicket, the batsman blocks it."
"1 run, dropped. Colin Munro puts down a straightforward catch. He had to move a little to his left alright, but he did well to get behind it and then just lets it pop out. A mistimed pull from the batsman that led to all of that drama."
"1 run, sticking with the short ball, and it's wide outside off again. DK taps it to point, but the throw has no one backing up. Allows them to collect the extra run."
"FOUR runs, drifting into the pads, the batsman flicks this past an ageing Yusuf, who fails to get there running back from midwicket. A slightly-more agile fielder would've stopped it on the dive."
"OUT, full toss outside off, the batsman reaches out to hit this well but picks out deep cover where Evin Lewis takes a dolly. Was the bowler looking to bowl a wide yorker? Doesn't matter, he's got the wicket somehow.."
"no run, full and skids on off, forward and driven to mid-off."
"1 run, good length outside off, and the batsman pokes at it off the back foot. Played to short third man."
"OUT, The extra ball fetches him the wicket! How rare is that. Flighted on middle, and Dhawan tried to slog sweep. It's the one that goes straight through and crashes into middle stump. Mishy-bhai is pumped!."
"no run, looks to walk across and whip this over square leg, played too early. Flicked the back pad on the way to the keeper."
"FOUR runs, fire with fire. Drops short, the batsman picks the length early, swivels back and pulls him all along the ground to the square leg boundary.."
"1 run, good stop from McClenaghan. Back of a length outside off, the batsman opens the bat face and guides a dab down to third man for a run.."
"1 run, good length on middle stump, and the batsman drops his gloves on this one. Worked to square leg off the back foot."

"1 run, punches that uppishly towards mid off and that reaches the fielder after a couple of bounces."
"1 run, eased with the spin to sweeper cover."
"1 run, good length and just outside off. Allows it to come on and steers it to third man with an open face."
"FOUR runs, sliced over point. Too full, too wide. Rohit sliced this full toss over Harbhajan. No chance for third man. That should ease some pressure in the Mumbai dug out."
"2 runs, targets the blockhole again, but the batsman clears his front leg and smears it to long-off. The crowd is going bonkers. They scream ""Ra-hul! Ra-hul! Ra-hul!."
"1 run, around the wicket to bowl side-arm offbreaks, like Kedar Jadhav. the batsman works it behind square leg."
"no run, steps out and turns this back to the bowler."
"1 run, too short and angling down, Dhawan swivels back and helps the pull on the bounce to fine leg."

"no run, back of a length and angling away wide outside off from round the stumps, the batsman slashes with all his might, but loses his shape, and only collects fresh air."
"no run, beauty first up. Snakes back in from length to kiss the outside edge?  Hardik reviews immediately.  the bowler the only one to appeal for this one.  There's a small little disturbance, can't really call it a spike.  Nothing conclusive, so the decision has been overturned. Kohli has a word with umpire Nitin Menon, more like letting out his frustration.."
"1 run, drills this slower ball down to long on."
"1 wide, he tries it again and concedes another wide. The wide yorker is well away from the tramline! Aargh.."

"no run, fullish length around off, the batsman nudges into the leg side."

"no run, brilliant stop by Raina at mid-off as the batsman slaps this off the backfoot and Raina dives to his left to intercept it."
"no run, short outside of, and Suryakumar cuts it late. Straight to short third man though. Slightly better direction and that would've been four."

"1 run, good length, slow and just outside off. Pushes with soft hands through cover."

"no run, good length, angled into the corridor. Chopped straight to point."

"1 run, full ball outside off, gets low and lofts a drive uppishly towards sweeper cover."
"1 run, sees the batsman advancing and fires this in, whipped to deep midwicket."
"OUT, has Stokes caught that cleanly? The umpires are going to have a look. In the batsman's slot for the lofted drive, which he hits hard and flat, but Stokes is on the boundary at long-on. He was stepping backwards as he took the catch over his head, about to tumble past the boundary, so he flicked it in the air, then stepped on the rope, and managed to return to the field of play and complete the catch comfortably enough in the end. Perhaps unwise of the batsman to take on the deep fielder in this situation, but he's played an excellent hand for KKR."
"1 run, short outside off, pulled to deep midwicket."
"FOUR runs, clears the keeper with a top edge. Same ball that got Rayudu to chop on. Except the batsman looks for the pull to this quick short ball outside off."
"FOUR runs, four in a row. Almost a replay of the previous ball. Drags it down short on off stump, and he skips away to make room and cut it away into that gap between backward point and cover point."

"1 run, this spins away from length on off stump, defended wide of cover for a quick single."
"OUT, first-ball duck! Full on off, and pushed to cover for a quick single. Rohit calls early, but that's super dangerous. Rahane collects, dives forward, and then throws under-hand. Off go to zing bails, and out goes Rohit!."
"OUT, after all the bad balls they have punished, Kings XI end up losing a wicket to a full toss. Wicket or boundary, it's almost as if CSK can't manage a delivery that doesn't make you flinch. the batsman punches it uppishly as he throws his weight behind the shot and finds DJ Bravo who leaps at cover to hold on to a sharp catch."
"1 run, eases this down to long on for an easy single."
"1 run, short and angling across off, slogs and top-edges it to deep third man."
"OUT, in the air, and brilliant catch by Karun Nair. Looked for a moment as though this was the usual the batsman, making merry against spin early on. It was a back-of-the-hand variant from the bowler, not quite the flipper, but it slides into the batsman's pads, and he steps down the track and mows this over long-on. Nair moves to his right and slides in front to complete a brilliant catch."
"1 run, dropped short again. Another offcutter. Outside off and he gets down to steer this to deep square."
"1 run, short of a length wide outside off, cut uppishly to point's left. He parries it to sweeper cover."

"no run, googly on a middle stump line, pushed anxiously back down the pitch."
"OUT, straight to extra cover! the batsman's daredevilry comes to a close. An aesthetically pleasing innings ends in a tame, throwaway manner. Length ball wide outside off. He gives it the charge and can't get elevation on the drive to clear the fielder."
"1 run, slower ball on off, tip and run to the off side."
"1 run, full on middle, swept to fine leg."
"FOUR runs, too short and he's pulled this into the deep midwicket boundary. Tripe bowling from Umesh. Superb the other night, very ordinary here."

"1 run, turns this gently into the midwicket region."
"no run, backs away to slap this over point but misses this high full toss. Keeper put his gloves out to stop that. Wasn't far from being over the waist."
"no run, takes it away from him this time, and the batsman swings and misses."
"1 run, driven with the spin to wide long off.."
"1 run, goes across again and fetches this slog sweep, on the bounce to deep midwicket."
"FOUR runs, swept fine, and it trickles away for a boundary. Full on leg stump, and the batsman shuffles across to the off side and paddles this to the leg side. Deep backward square loses the chase."
"1 run, full delivery that tails away a hint from off stump, driven to deep cover."
"1 run, touch short again, whips this to deep square leg."
"1 run, shorter on middle, swatted to long-on off the back foot."
"1 leg bye, pacy delivery, swing and a miss. Deflects off the pad to the off side, leg bye."
"FOUR runs, back of a length and outside off, the ball flies off the batsman's bat. He flat-bats it fiercely past the right of sweeper cover. Regal shot.."
"no run, makes room and charges, the bowler yorks him and the batsman bunts it to cover point."
"1 run, good length on off stump, and enough room for the batsman to free his arms. Pulled hard, but not well, to Curran at deep midwicket."
"1 wide, yorker, but way outside leg stump. Suryakumar misses the flick, but Mumbai still earn the run."
"no run, full on off stump, but no real spin this time. Defended off the front foot."
"FOUR runs, makes room yet again and gets enough of it to free his arms again to slam that square of the wicket for four this time. The length is not that bad, but this batsman isn't bad either."

"1 run, nicely flighted outside off, the batsman moves towards the ball and bunts it down to long on."

"1 run, good length on off, and that's been pulled along the ground to deep midwicket."
"1 run, drills this straight to Williamson at the edge of the ring at cover."
"no run, googly, spinning into the corridor. He makes room to try and cut but this spins to take the under-edge and roll into the point region."
"2 runs, outside off and steered to third man. A really wide throw helps them come back."
"1 run, in the block hole outside off, he jams his bat in and gets a single behind square."
"1 run, looks to scoop this fine but is off balance, gets it high on the bat but this lands short of Mujeeb at short fine leg.  Mujeeb picked it late and was late to move forward ."
"1 run, dropped. Rashid's movement in his follow through has completely blinded him it seems. Length ball driven back at him and his hands are barely in place as it fizzes past him and goes to long-off."
"1 run, flat outside off, a punch to long-off from the back foot."
"1 run, good length just outside off, and the batsman defends with soft hands towards third man."

"2 runs, back of a length and outside off, chopped in the gap at point."

"no run, full just outside off, and the batsman meets the drive on the full. Only to cover."
"OUT, the batsman steps out, the bowler foxes him with a quicker googly, hits the thigh pad. Lbw appeal, but umpire Llong does not budge. Going down leg? Mumbai go for a review. Spins in, bounces to hit the front flap, the tracker returns three reds. Umpire Llong is bemused. He reverses his decision."
"no run, given! the bowler hits the pad of the batsman and it seemed pretty plumb. But the batsman has no hesitation in going for the review. Could he have got an inside edge? This may be too high. the bowler gets this to skid in off a length and the batsman has indeed got an inside edge on the flick. And it seems as though the ball may have gone over as well."
"1 run, flighted ball on off stump, swept along the ground to deep square leg."
"2 runs, backs away and cuts the legbreak to point. The throw comes in, and it's three or four feet away from the wicketkeeper and nearly results in four overthrows."
"2 runs, steps out and slaps this slower ball towards wide long off again, Finch comes around to put up a sliding stop."
"1 run, back of a length and outside off, eased to third man."

"1 run, pulls this slower length ball down to long on."

"1 run, full around off, driven to mid-on for a single. Full face of the bat.."
"no run, middle-stump yorker, backs away and digs it out to mid-off."
"1 wide, called a wide! Was that over the head? A short delivery outside off, a knuckle ball bouncer that is indeed over the head. This is not very good bowling, why vary to a No. 7 when he isn't trying too much.."
"FOUR runs, another shortish one, and ample of room. Jeez, when will they start bowling closer at the stumps. the batsman barely has to get the front foot away to slap it through long-off."
"1 run, drops the length this time. Good length on off stump, and the batsman comes dancing down the wicket. Tapped towards cover, and they complete the single. Knight Riders finish on 191 for 7."
"no run, short of good length, a bit of nip away, punched to cover."
"no run, mistimes a forceful hit down the ground, straight to mid on."
"1 run, pretty full on off, Hardik can't get under it. He hacks it off the inside half to deep midwicket. He collides with the bowler and collapses at the non-striker's end. So, Mumbai have to settle with a single."

"no run, worked to midwicket."
"1 run, drills this full delivery to long off.."
"OUT, gone! A full toss! the batsman skips down the pitch and gets a shin height full toss tailing in at him that is ripe for a drilling through midwicket. It's what he was looking to do as well. Except, there's a gap between bat and pad and the inside edge sneaks through to smash the stumps oh it takes his back boot on the way too."
"1 wide, misses his line completely. Slower ball, but short and outside leg stump, the batsman tries to whip this fine behind leg but can't get bat to ball."

"1 run, good length on off stump, and the batsman carves this to point for a quick single. Gets Bravo back on strike."

"2 runs, muscles this length delivery into the gap at midwicket, down to Negi who comes around from deep square."
"2 runs, back of a length outside off, but angling into his body. Drags it behind square on the leg side, and some more work for Shaw in the deep."

"no run, full on off, presses forward and bunts it to mid-off."

"1 run, eases this full delivery down to long on."
"1 run, slog-sweeps the wide delivery to deep midwicket.."
"SIX runs, Such a smooth swing from the batsman. Looped up full on middle, dances down the track and launches it over the bowler's head."
"1 run, direct hit would have had the batsman! Rahane at extra cover has one stump to aim at. And only misses it by a clump of whiskers! Another slower ball from the bowler throws up great action."
"no run, flatter and shorter outside off, chopped away to point."
"no run, 104 kph, the batsman clears his front leg, gives himself some room and drills a drive to mid-off."

"no run, goes short! Pitches on off and jags away from the batsman. Tries to pull, but he's nowhere near the ball. Through to Karthik from near his face."
"OUT, so much turn, he's got the off stump! After that wide, the bowler goes wide outside off, wide enough to tempt the batsman into a cut and he tries that but it turns in viciously to knock the stumps over!."
"SIX runs, shot, Shubman! This was pitched up and outside off, right in his arc, the batsman collapses his back leg and drives it up and over extra cover. Goes all the way for six."

"1 run, the batsman forays down the track, meets a full-toss outside off, and hits it down to long-on."

"SIX runs, short and veering into the hips, you've got to got it up higher, the bowler. the batsman sizes it up and short-arms it away over square leg. Sweet swing of the bat."

"1 run, nudges this length ball into the leg side and Yusuf is struggling with his back as he limps the single."

"SIX runs, stunning! Did someone say he's a nudger of the ball? This is a lovely stroke, pure cricketing stroke. Backed away, got to the pitch of the ball and lofted it cleanly over mid-off. Sailed over the ropes. Don't think he realised how well he hit it until it landed over the ropes."
"1 run, whips this full delivery to deep midwicket. Another mix-up, Tripathi had to dive full stretch to get back after the batsman said no quite late for the second. Correct call in the end, there was no second run there.."
"FOUR runs, superb. It's a different game when the pacers are one. Even though they're bowling cutters. It's a length ball wide outside off. He waits for it to arrive and chops it between backward point and short third man."
"no run, back of a length and outside off, ignored."
"OUT, another painstaking the batsman innings comes to an end. Was in no control of this lofted hit. Sliced this slower delivery to point, where Rahane moved a couple of steps back to complete the catch. Royals continue to surge.."

"no run, clears the front leg to swing hard and swing free. But the change of pace - knuckle ball - does not allow him to make contact."

"FOUR runs, another overpitched delivery outside off, the batsman just uses what he's given and throws his arms at the width to get some free IPL runs. Smashed through cover.."
"2 runs, bottom hand, all of it. How else was it possible for him to get under such a full delivery and hit it in the air? Slogged away to deep midwicket, the fielder runs in, the ball is just short.."
"1 run, short of a length, cuts in, opens the face and runs it down to short third man."

"2 runs, dropped at deep extra cover! Short outside off, and this time the batsman's luck almost ran out. Cut it over the infield, but top-edged to the man in the deep. His diving effort just isn't good enough as the ball pops out of his hand. Barinder Sran the guilty party there."

Hardik Pandya's hands on his head, he was the man who threw the ball. Kishan's still on the floor, and the team management look worried. His right eye looks very swollen.

"1 run, flicks a length ball through square leg."
"1 run, flatter and fuller on the stumps, eased to long on."

"no run, slips in a yorker-length delivery across the batsman, who can't reach out to squeeze this awa."
"1 run, run out chance missed. Shakib fails to pick up the ball at extra cover after running in. The batsmen are only just crossing over halfway down the pitch. Hardik dropped this pitch side with soft hands."
"1 run, neatly in the block hole, driven down with hard hands to long on."
"FOUR runs, back of a length and angling in at off stump, the batsman rolls his wrists, and pulls it away in the gap at square leg. First boundary after 21 balls for RCB."
"1 run, slider on off, whipped across the line to long on."

"no run, full on leg stump, the batsman taps it to midwicket."
"1 run, flat and straight, a thick inside edge towards midwicket."
"no run, full nip-backer from the bowler, the batsman is late onto it as the ball skids off the pitch. He squirts an inside edge onto the pad and weathers an lbw appeal."
"no run, slower bouncer foxes the batsman. He wants to leave it, just outside off. But he realises it's a slower one and thinks momentarily about trying to jab it over the keeper. It's too late and he's unhappy:  ""oh nooooooo""."
"no run, short, extra bounce outside off as he slashes and misses."

"no run, short and wide from the bowler, not the best start. Slashed away to backward point.."

"no run, lifter outside off, fizzes off the pitch, beats the batsman's hook. Beaten for pace and bounce."

"1 run, full and flat on middle, driven along to long-off."
"2 runs, full toss on leg stump, and he's cramped for room. Hits his bat and trickles away towards mid-wicket. No one there, so that means Archer asks the batsman to come for the second."

"1 wide, length ball spins down leg side and past his attempted flick."
"SIX runs, the batsman reminding people that he's still here, and as long as he is, write off SRH at your own peril. This one's a fuller one outside off, right in the slot, and just what the newcomer wanted. Frees up his arms and shellacks it straight over."

"no run, back of a length outside off, 130 kph. the batsman finds point with a dab."

"SIX runs, short on middle and leg, and the batsman steps across and pulls it over the backward square leg boundary - picks out the short boundary on that side, and clears it despite only managing a 64m hit. Didn't look to hit it too hard, just helped it and found the gap to the right of deep square leg."

"no run,  nearly a return catch, and nearly a run-out at the bowler's end too  the batsman toe-ends a low full toss as he shapes to drive back."
"FOUR runs, lbw appeal followed by a four. Another inswinger, veers onto the pads, picked off to the square leg boundary."

"1 run, lucky to get away with that tripe delivery. De Kock rocks back and pulls this to deep midwicket."
"2 runs, is that four again? No, no quite. This time the fielder gets around it. An attempted yorker gone wrong, it's a low full toss that's been whipped between midwicket and long-on, and the latter gets around it."
"no run, dabs this length ball to slip. Tried to pick the gap between keeper and slip. Brave."
"no run, good length on off stump, but angling across the batsman. Tries to carve it towards point, but goes past the outside edge and through to the keeper. Bhuvi wants to review, but they're out of reviews.."
"4 byes, walks across for an ill-advised paddle to a back of a length delivery that's around two sets of stumps outside off. Needless to say, gets nowhere near it."
"1 wide, bouncer dug in too short. He half-jabs at it. It's too high."
"1 run, tossed up on leg stump. the batsman backs away and drives inside out to long off. Dealing in ones and twos for now."
"FOUR runs, overpitched ball just outside off. Front leg out of the way and carved through cover. No fuss, too simple.."
"no run, huuuuuuge appeal for lbw but the umpire isn't swayed by it. Beautiful bowling from the bowler, pitching up to the new batsman, getting the ball to curl into him late. the batsman is not at all ready for the fiendish delivery. He tries to play a shot into the leg side and possibly gets an inside edge? Cause otherwise that kinda looks plumb."
"1 leg bye, quicker and flatter on off, the batsman ventures a reverse-sweep and deflects it over Rahane at slip off the forearm."
"1 run, full on leg, and that's been drilled to midwicket. A diving effort from the fielder there saves the single."

"SIX runs, more brawn from the batsman. Another bottom-handed jab as the bowler overcompensates and bowls it fuller outside his off-stump. Smashed over long-on."
"2 runs, full on off, and that's been carved towards backward point. Chase for the fielder in the deep, which allows the batsman to come back for the second."
"FOUR runs, clobbered! This time on the bounce, bisects deep midwicket and long-on. He went length, got punished.."
"2 runs, full toss, smacked towards deep cover where Shakib throws in a dive to cut that off."
"FOUR runs, back of a length outside off, and he punches it off the back foot. Beats the man at cover, and Rashid's dive at the boundary is futile. Big finish to the Powerplay."
"SIX runs, short again, not sure what the bowler is trying here! Forget the off side, the batsman rocks back this time and pulls it high and wide over long-on."
"OUT, too cheeky, and Kishan pays the price. Full toss outside off, and Kishan opens his bat's face to ramp it over the keeper. Doesn't manage to get the angle he wants, and therefore in the air for ages. Buttler collects and finally the partnership ends after almost 14 overs."
"FOUR runs, dude should have been out last ball, instead he gets a hip-high full toss as a free hit and launches it to the square leg boundary. This is the craziest Powerplay ever!."

"no run, the batsman forays down the track, knuckle ball, bounces and beats the batsman outside off."
"1 run, gets room to free his arms and he does, along the ground to deep point."
"OUT, has hit this straight to long-on. Dragged this from outside, bat face turned in his hand which meant there was no power and AB took this nicely running around the ropes. Clever from the bowler as well, didn't give the batsman much pace to work with as he rolled his fingers over the ball.."
"FOUR runs, splits the gap between short third man and point. Used the width to good effect. Opened the bat face slightly to pick the gap. Lovely.."
"no run, the free-hit ball is a yorker outside off, skids past the outside edge and off stump."
"1 run, excellent delivery to start off, a yorker that's dug out to long-on."
"SIX runs, there it goes! High into the night sky. Up into the second tier above long-on. And all the batsman does is clear the front leg and give it the full swing. Jeez, how much power does he have?."
"1 run, quicker ball, full on middle and leg. It's the googly too, so cramps the batsman for room. Does well to flick it to midwicket."
"no run, tossed up on middle, presses forward and drives to midwicket."
"OUT, drills this straight to mid on. the batsman checked his shot, not sure why, and has to go as Shami takes a comfortable catch.."

"no run, short of a length on off, stands tall and punches towards mid-on."
"2 runs, change up, and short on off stump. the batsman backs away to make some room, and bunts it over the bowler's head. Some work for long off, but he does well to keep it down to two."
"1 run, walks across the stumps and wrists this full delivery down to long on."
"OUT, no room on the pull as the batsman shifts right back and gets a top-edge that Dhoni runs to his left to catch."

"1 run, short outside off, and that's been defended off the back foot towards cover."
"FOUR runs, too much movement from the batsman, but still manages to clear mid off. It was slow outside off, and he walked across to the off side before checking his movement. Was in an uncomfortable position, but still manages to lift it over mid off."
"SIX runs, backs away and deposits this length ball into the second tier at midwicket. Very predictable there from the bowler."
"FOUR runs, picks the gap. Fetches the pull from outside off, split the gap between square leg and short fine."
"4 byes, past the outside edge and past the keeper. A nicely tossed up length ball outside off. He doesn't get to the pitch for the drive through cover and it spins a long way past him."
"no run, flat, dart outside off, chopped away to the covers."
"1 run, risky, risky single. Rahul has muffed a take again as the throw comes in from cover point. Gambhir was made to stretch. Makes it in time.."
"1 run, reaches deep midwicket after a bounce. It kept low but the batsman managed to pull it away nicely."
"SIX runs, goes again, six more. He's just picking length very quickly. Once he does that, it's all a bit too easy for class batsmen, like de Villiers. the batsman shows some of his skill with a bottom-handed loft over mid-on.."
"1 run, backs away, so Hardik goes full and wide, the batsman toe-ends this swing across the line to long on."
"no run, much fuller and tighter on off, the batsman presses forward to smother it."

"1 run, full on leg stump, and that's been well bowled! Angling into his toes, and it can't be put away."
"FOUR runs, good length on middle stump, but the batsman is quick to walk across to the off side, before whipping this over square leg! the bowler expensive again."
"OUT, Another dismissal against wristspin for the batsman. Excellent bowling from the bowler, saw the batsman coming early and tossed it wider and slower. He ended up too much under the ball and not enough behind it, and it was the googly too, spinning away from him and causing him to skew his attempted slog over mid-on to the man at cover, who moved backwards and to his left to get under the skier."
"no run, waits for the ball around off stump and defends to point."
"no run, short of a length and wide outside off. Slaps it on the up, straight to extra cover."
"no run, a slower delivery around off, defended with the full face of the bat.."
"1 wide, OUT, this time Kishan stumps! the bowler goes wide outside off again, and the batsman's stranded once more. Kishan collects it well this time, and easily removes the batsman's stumps. Rohit looks impressed with Kishan's glovework. The batsman came down the ground way too early."
"SIX runs, that's as flat a six as you'll ever see. Floated up outside off, the batsman gets down for a slog, fetches it from outside off and it sails flat over long-on."
"1 run, good length outside off, and angling into Hardik. That allows him to pull to deep midwicket."
"1 run, short of a length, spinning in, punched away through the covers."
"1 wide, sprays it horribly down the leg side and Parthiv, standing up to him, does well to dive to his right and stop it."

"no run, full and outside off, drives to cover, where Williamson doesn't let it through."
"OUT, four, six, and out! the batsman screams in agony. He runs down the track, the bowler bowls a slider, angling in from around the stumps, the batsman does not meet the pitch, the spinner hits the middle stump."
"OUT, full outside off, and he's sliced it! Shaw's getting under it from extra cover, and he holds on to a pressure catch. Iyer comes to celebrate with the youngster. Silences the crowd."
"OUT, doesn't read the googly! Ignorance is clearly not bliss, at least if you're Karun the batsman and Kings XI. The poor guy gets forward to block what he thinks is a leg break and is comfortably beaten on the inside edge. Great control of length from Rashid, suddenly pushing this one fuller, and slowing the pace too.."
"no run, flat start, on off. No flight. Worked to midwicket with the spin.."
"no run, on the pads, skewed away to square leg."
"no run, shortish around off, tries to flick and the ball goes off the outside of the bat down the pitch."

"no run, skidding in to beat the inside edge and hit the thigh."
"1 run, short on leg stump. the batsman tries to swivel, but can't pull effectively. Played to deep backward square."
"FOUR runs, short, angling down and the batsman just helps this over short fine leg. Too easy."
"no run, inswinger rises from a good length at off stump. He fends it away as he trues to defend."

"no run, nudged to midwicket from the back foot."
"FOUR runs, carted! What power. the bowler having an ordinary time. Length ball wide outside off and he climbs into this, on the up."
"1 run, a slower ball on middle, clipped to deep midwicket for one. Decent over from the bowler."
"no run, slides back in and skids through to hit the pad as the batsman looks to work this gently into the leg side."
"no run, walks across and pummels this short of a length delivery straight back at the bowler, who gets a hand and half-stops it. Recovers and gets to the ball quickly to make sure it's a dot."
"FOUR runs, now he finds the gap past that fielder. This is terrific batting. Steps down the track and gets right to the pitch before lacing a drive through the left of the extra cover fielder. Top shot."

"1 run, full on middle stump, backs away and skews it over the bowler's head."

"FOUR runs, another half-tracker on middle, Baz sizes it up and thumps a pull to the left of the leg umpire."
"no run, full just outside off, and the batsman shuffles forward to tap it towards the off side."
"no run, slower length ball, opens the face to backward point."
"1 run, slices it but no one to take it as it lands near short midwicket! the batsman can't get the hook away against a quick bouncer. It looks like Umesh has pulled something in his leg, because this wasn't too far from him for the catch. He couldn't get anywhere near it."
"OUT,  back-to-back wrong'uns  and the batsman's gone. Picks the googly, but too close for the cut. This keeps a touch low as the batsman chops on! RCB in real trouble."
"FOUR runs, inside edge zips past short fine. the bowler starts in a nice area - length on off stump. the batsman brings an angled bat down on it as he pushes on the front foot. Tentative. Effective.."

"no run, good length outside off, defends towards point off the front foot."
"FOUR runs, full on middle, and angling into his toes. Too easy for the batsman to simply flick it off his legs and past midwicket. Sloppy effort from Karn."
"1 wide, another wide googly, keeps very low. But outside the tramlines."
"FOUR runs, opens the face and launches the intended wide yorker over extra cover. That's fifty, off 48 balls.."
"1 run, length on leg stump, pushed deftly through square leg."

"OUT, Poor from the batsman. Full outside off, and Dre Russ slaps this over point once again. Slices it this time, and Pandey - at point - runs towards the boundary to complete an excellent diving catch! Slides across the ground after pocketing that. Pandey's been electric today."
"SIX runs, now the batsman's joining in! Picks the slower ball nice and early, and DK slogs this over long on with disdain! Nineteen off the 17th over."
"1 run, drops and runs to cover."
"OUT, Jadeja's brilliance has made this catch possible at deep midwicket. Surya picked the length early, rocked back and pulled this ferociously. Jadeja covered plenty of ground to his left and then put in the slide to complete the catch even as the ball was dying on him.."
"1 run, full on middle, driven past the right of the bowler to long-on."
"FOUR runs, the batsman takes a leaf out of Dhoni's book and walks across too. It's an attempted yorker gone wrong as it ends up being a low full toss. the batsman doesn't quite muster up the same power as Dhoni but it's enough, nevertheless, to carry the ball to long-on."
"1 run, short ball, and the batsman's eyes must have lit up for a second, because it looked eminently pullable, but it kept low. Kept his eyes on it and shovelled it down to long-on instead."
"no run, rolls his fingers over this short ball wide outside off. the batsman through the cut too early and is beaten."
"no run, good length on off, and the batsman tries to slap this over the bowler's head. Played down the wrong line, and the delivery's through to Tare."
"1 run, gets on top of a short one and taps it to backward point."
"FOUR runs, the back flip to beat short third man. Disdainful. Shaped to play the lap shot over short fine, saw the length ball angle away and then flicked it up and over short third man."
"no run, short of a length outside off, punched straight to point off the back foot."
"1 run, once again cramped for room as he jabs this towards midwicket. Got it on the top part of the bat."

"SIX runs, huuuge! Runs down to the pitch, gets close enough and T20s the ball away over midwicket. A big hoick across the line, 95 metres.."
"no run, looking for the late cut but fails to connect. Short and wide outside off, the batsman misses his dab."
"OUT, the bowler has his fourth with his last ball of the night. Wrong'un, breaks away outside off, the batsman reads it off the pitch, and drags a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. What a spell from the bowler. He ends with a potentially match-winning 4-0-23-4."
"no run, a short delivery that isn't quite straight. A bouncer outside off, the batsman lets that one go.."
"no run, good length on off, and spinning further away. Carved off the back foot to cover. Almost lost his balance there."

"1 run, a yorker outside off, jammed into the pitch and then over mid-off for a run.."

"1 run, full and wide outside off, a thick outside edge down to third man for a run."
"SIX runs, goes again, clears deep midwicket again! Didn't quite get to the pitch of the ball, picked the googly and went through with it from outside off. Dhawan was quite a long way in. May have been in a better position to catch if he was at the ropes.."
"no run, bounces him this time, de Villiers is prepared for it, sways back to ramp the ball over short third man. He misses it. Miracles do happen."
"1 run, full on middle stump, and slight outswing first up. Driven down the ground to mid on for a quick single."
"1 run, skidding into the pads, nearly 100ks, nudged through square leg."
"1 run, leading edge but it finds its way through to long-off. Karun tries to come down the track, the bowler pulls his length back, the batsman plays against the turn, and what little comes off the pitch, produces a mis-hit."

"no run, full on off, spins slightly inwards. Tries to drive away from his body, but mistimed to cover point."
"1 run, slower ball, and angling across the batsman. With all his might, the batsman tries to slog, but can only find the man at long on."

"2 runs, chipped over the bowler. Doesn't look in control at first but this has flown off the bat as he tries to drive through the line. Bends inwards and keeps going away from long-off who has to parry it to long-on."
"1 wide, another wide yorker attempted, another wide.."
"FOUR runs, thick outside edge, streaky but he'll take the runs. Too full on off, he looked to dive but got the edge that squeezed between keeper and short third man.."

"no run, angles this length delivery into the pads, no swing and the batsman works it to midwicket."
"no run, length ball outside off, leans in nicely to tap on the up. Can't get it past cover though. Bit of a mix-up as they're both ball watching. the batsman runs back after covering half the pitch."

"FOUR runs, on a length on off, the batsman clears his front leg and whips it away to the midwicket boundary. Top timing from the batsman."

"OUT, holes out to deep midwicket, Cutting takes a superb catch running to his right. What's happening here! A short ball from Hardik, the batsman pulled and that hardly went any distance beyond the 30-yard circle, Cutting wasn't at the boundary but well inside and he did well to run a few yards to his right and slide to catch that."

"1 wide, full outside leg stump, and it's the offcutter on this occasion. Goes down the batsman's leg side though."

"2 runs, flat on middle, swept away through backward square leg."
"FOUR runs, inside out over cover! Slightly extra air given this time, and the ball is lifted over the infield with disdain. Get the batsman up the order!."
"SIX runs, crackalicious! How's that to win the match - a six over wide long-on with so much strength it's landed into the crowd. the batsman absolutely bludgeoned that by going across and swinging it over the cow corner like that night at Wankhede in April 2011. Bravo lifts his arms and goes across to embrace MS the batsman, who's cool as ever. Harbhajan comes out and lifts the batsman!."
"no run, this is a sensational delivery! Tails in late to hit CDG flush on his toe. Such a comprehensive appeal resonated by 40,000 fans in the ground. But SRH don't have a review! Good call from umpire Virender Sharma, though. Missing leg stump.."
"no run, good length outside off, and some extra bounce first up. Punched off the back foot to point, and well stopped by the fielder. Diving effort stops the single."
"1 leg bye, the bowler appeals loudly for lbw as the batsman goes down on a knee to sweep that to the leg side but misses it. Not given as runs and Kohli reviews it. It hit the batsman around his waist but height may not be a problem, did it pitch in line? Pitches in line, and that has actually gone past and over stump so RCB lose a review.."

"1 run, good length outside off, dabs away to third man with an open bat face."

"no run, turning into the pads, tucked to square leg."

"no run, skids through from length, Rohit gets a thick inside edge to midwicket."

"no run, darted short and outside off, chopped straight to backward point off the back foot."
"1 wide, sees the batsman advancing and takes it away from him but drifts away too much outside off."
"1 run, full on middle, and that's been swept! Down on one knee, and sent to the man at the fine-leg boundary."

"OUT, the third bouncer of the over? It's short again, goes past Rinku's pull again. Kohli thinks there is a definite edge on the pull. So he chooses to review. That is definitely at least the second bouncer of the over? RCB keep bowling bouncers and keep getting away with it, not their fault if the umpires are not calling them, obviously. Replays indicate there is an edge on that, so Rinku will have to go. He should have got at least one no-ball this over, though. I've not seen a single one-bouncer signal from an umpire today.."
"FOUR runs, sliced over extra cover. Not timed well at all from the batsman. It's a length ball going away off the pitch. He wants to go in that direction, but the poor connection means it's one bounce and into the boundary."
"OUT, The zing bails light up! Super fast (144kph) on off stump and angling right into the batsman. He tries to defend it straight, but the ball goes between bat and pad. Crashes into middle stump."

"no run, full and wide outside off, the ball bounces over the batsman's drive.."
"1 run, slower bouncer outside off, glided to third man."
"OUT, picks out mid-on! I'm not sure what kind of a shot that was. Flat and straight, the batsman just chips a drive to mid-on, did he try to go over? Or past him? That does not seem like a very clever shot, did it hold up? Something definitely did happen that resulted in a tame bunt to the fielder. the bowler doesn't care.."
"SIX runs, goes beyond cow corner! Nicely flighted on leg stump, and Kishan uses his feet to get to the pitch of the ball. Proper slog towards the leg side thereafter."

"1 run, yorker on middle stump, and Virat does well to dig it towards cover. Only a single."
"FOUR runs, good length outside off, and the batsman rides the bounce to punch this past point. Kept his bat's face open, and lets the pace of Mavi do the rest."

"no run, width outside off, drilled to the man at the edge of the ring at cover."
"no run, goes back into the crease and defends this length ball."
"1 run, good length on middle stump, and that's been worked off his hips to backward square leg."
"no run, wide yorker, sneaks under the bat. Three dots to end the over. Gold."
"1 run, back of a length outside off, pushed away to mid-on for a quick single. Suryakumar judged that run very well. There is a direct hit at the bowler's end, but Ravi doesn't go to the third umpire. Excellent umpiring, got into position early to make that decision."
"SIX runs, chest-high short ball on the leg stump, the batsman does not have room to free his arms but still manages to pull it flat and hard over long leg."
"FOUR runs, good length on middle stump, and the batsman's quick to gauge the length. Swivels and pulls this along the carpet to the deep backward-square boundary. The extra ball hurts the bowler."
"OUT, given! the bowler strikes. Suryakumar has been given out lbw, will he review? Yes. He wants to check, did it pitch outside leg? No. Did it slide past leg? Was there some glove? There was no immediate review from Suryakumar, so he didn't think so. There's a thin spike on UltraEdge. HawkEye shows the ball is just clipping the side of leg stump. So Mumbai keep their review, but lose Suryakumar. He was looking for a sweep through square leg, but missed the ball. It pitched on leg and slid on.."
"OUT, the bowler wins an lbw appeal from umpire Chris Gaffaney. the batsman challenges the on-field out decision. DRS makes an appearance in the IPL. Is this swinging past the leg stump? Nippy inswinger from the bowler, pitches on middle and leg and swerves in to ping the pad as the batsman falls over the leg-side flick. The tracker suggests it would go on to clip the outside of the leg stump. Umpire's call it is and the batsman bags a duck on IPL debut."
"no run, the slider. Quick down leg, the batsman misses a flick. Struck on the thigh pad as he misses that.."
"no run, very full on off, the batsman hangs back again, played back to the bowler."
"no run, another off-stump yorker, jammed back to the bowler."
"1 run, good length on middle stump. Goes deep into the crease and whips it to square to deep midwicket."
"OUT, Sunrisers have their man finally. Back of a length and angling away outside off, Kishan looks to slog it away against the angle and across the line. Another low-percentage shot. This time he skies it to deep third man, where Yusuf Pathan slides on his knees and completes a sharp, low catch despite being blinded by the floodlights."
"OUT, no room to swing, so he ends up slicing this pull to Markande at point. This is very good from the bowler, hit the deck hard to extract bounce. The effort ball has done the trick. Well held by the 20-year old. Mumbai are roaring back at the death.."
"no run, this a gem of a delivery from the bowler! Back of a length, angling in from wide of the crease, sharp angle from the bowler. Then straightens away outside off, past the outside edge. Ultra Edge detects a nick. Mumbai, however, did not go for a review. How costly will that turn out to be?."
"1 run, full on off stump, and lifted over the non-striker. But man's there at long on."
"1 run, back of a length, slides in on middle, hammered to long-on."
"FOUR runs, poor ball. Googly, short and wide outside off. Chopped away to the backward point boundary. Too easy."
"FOUR runs, just outside off and the batsman gets a reverse sweep on that one, no power only guides it fine and gets four."
"no run, a googly outside off, moving further across, cut to cover.."
"1 run, full, angled across around off, makes sure to give himself enough room and drives to long-off."
"FOUR runs, inside edge! This game has had everything, and now this too. A trusty slog that becomes a sneaky boundary, beating Thampi."
"no run, much better from Sran. Stick to the basics. Good length on middle and leg, defended back.."
"no run, moves a bit too much to off to make room, the bowler replies with a full delivery outside off and Curran swings and misses."
"1 run, back of a length, slides across with the angle, the batsman stays back and whips it to wide long-on."
"no run, he pitches it a touch shorter, the batsman waits and steers to cover point patiently."
"no run, fullish length outside off, slashes at it and drills it to cover."
"OUT, strikes first ball, the batsman holes out to long off! Tall man de Grandhomme takes a couple steps back at long off and raises his arms over his head to grab the ball and just keeps his feet inside the boundary. It was pitched up, the batsman went straight down the ground but didn't get enough for this small ground."
"1 wide, another one that strays down leg, wide. Just like the bowler' previous over."
"2 runs, full just outside off, and nudged off the front foot towards cow corner. Hit gently enough, and that allows them the second run."
"no run, mistimes a drive to mid on."
"no run, yorker-length on the stumps from wide of the crease, squeezed back towards the bowler.."
"SIX runs, smashed over wide long on! This game's back alive, folks! Tossed up on leg stump and the batsman whips this off his toes and into the stands. Excellent bat speed!."
"SIX runs, shot! This is the batsman's arrival. It's taken some time. Stunning hit. A knuckle ball dug in short outside off. No pace off the pitch but somehow he has pummelled this, one the up, with a flat bat over long-off."
"OUT, big appeal for lbw from the bowler. This looks plumb. Umpire Nandan, however, shoots down the appeal. SRH challenge the on-field not-out decision. Another knuckle ball, hits the back pad in front of middle as the batsman plays across the line early and misses the ball altogether. It would have crashed into middle stump. Umpire Nandan eventually reverses his decision."
"FOUR runs, walks across the stumps and simply helps this slower bouncer over short fine leg. Easily done."
"1 run, good length outside off, but angling into the batsman. He tiptoes and glances it towards point. Nice, early call for the single."
"SIX runs, shifts over the wicket and is sent over the fence at long leg! the batsman has been starving himself of runs just so that he can feast in the death! All through the middle overs he's been dabbing the ball for singles and twos. And now, at the pointy end, he's swivelling on the back foot and pulling short balls to oblivion."
"no run, arm ball on off, and zipping straight through. He came down the ground to try and slog it, but the ball stayed low and crept under his bat. Hits his back leg."
"1 run, slider that drifts back in to keep a touch low, the batsman eases this down to deep point."
"no run, short on off, chopped only as far as point."
"OUT, conventional legbreak, and that earns him the wicket! Straight to long off. Full outside off, and the batsman plays it straight down the ground. The ball spun away slightly, and induced the shot from the bat's toe end. the bowler makes amends after all!."
"2 runs, another cross-batted stroke, the reverse sweep, it's the legbreak on middle and off. the batsman places this nicely through point, all along the ground. A good diving stop from Hardik, running to his right."
"1 run, short of a length outside off, chops it to point's left."
"FOUR runs, sees the batsman stepping out and fires this wide. No problem, the batsman does well to reach out and then slam this inside-out over cover. Foxed him but he still had enough to use his reach to pick this.."
"no run, full on middle and leg, and the batsman tries to drive towards mid on. Takes the leading edge towards mid off instead."
"1 run, leading edge goes over the bowler. It's a back-of-the-hand slower ball that loops in at middle stump. De Villiers gets it on the full but he hasn't picked it. His flick ends up at mid-off."
"SIX runs, that's even better. Steps down the track and mows this over long-on. A typical the batsman strike, just giving the impression that it may not be clean, and then sailing well over."
"1 run, a slower delivery outside off, guided to point for a tight single."
"no run, gets on top of the bounce and punches to point."
"1 run, full and swinging back in outside off, worked away with the angle of swing to wide mid-on."
"1 run, good length on middle stump, and punched off the back foot to long on.."
"1 run, bit of flight outside off and the batsman paddles it away to long leg."
"FOUR runs, short and wide, slapped away to deep point."
"1 run, banged in short on off again, the batsman takes a step forward, the ball gets big on him, fended off to the leg side for one."
"OUT, Bowled'em. First ball to the batsman, the bowler has him chopping on. Narine is strong v spin, but the batsman isn't as strong. This was a low-arm slider from the bowler, wide of the crease, slides in at off, cramps the batsman for room. He hastily jabs his bat down and drags an inside edge back onto the stumps."
"no run, falls short of Rahane at second slip! Lovely delivery to the new batsman, hitting a good length, probing in the off-stump corridor. the batsman pokes at it, gets an outside edge, but he's played with hands just about soft enough."
"1 run, fullish around off, drilled extremely hard one-bounce to long-off."
"1 run, a legbreak, and straight. Slogged to deep square leg.."
"SIX runs, Mavi lobs it over the boundary! Oh so close. the bowler tosses this right up and the batsman has to think twice before pulling out the slog. Doesn't get a lot of bat on it. Mavi is behind it at long-on but looks like he's panicked right at the end."
"SIX runs, tossed up outside off, and enough width for the big man. Big wind up of the bat, and thumped over the bowler's head. Off the bat's toe end, but enough muscle behind that shot."
"no run, good length outside off, and zipping straight through. Tries to cut but misses."
"1 run, full on off again. Drives it down the ground - against the spin - to long off."
"2 runs, nudges a full delivery on off stump through to long-on."
"1 run, back of a length around off, Faf is hurried for pace as he defends close to his feet and calls Watson through for one. Not a bad over, still 10 off it."
"1 run, back of a length and outside off, sensibly dabbed down to short third man."
"1 run, pulled away, not in control. Deep square does well to come around.."
"FOUR runs, full outside off, and this time the slower ball has deceived the batsman beautifully. But the game's cruel, so Hardik will earn a boundary. Slices this drive over DK's head."
"FOUR runs, shortish and just a shade outside off, the batsman angles his bat and chops it away fine of third man for his first boundary."
"1 run, tries to repeat it, but can only mistime it down the ground to long on. Full on off, and played down the ground again."
"FOUR runs, and just to prove that he and the coaching manual are still good buds, he essays a picture perfect cover drive to finish the game off.."
"1 run, slow and full on the stumps, whipped with the wrists to leg."
"SIX runs, great use of his feet! Good length on middle, and Rohit comes dancing down the wicket to whip it over midwicket. Into the stands at cow corner."
"no run, short and angled across, Parthiv flays a cut to point."
"1 run, the batsman rides the bounce of this short ball outside off and cuts to deep point."
"SIX runs, juicy full toss and the batsman wallops this into the stands beyond deep midwicket. Too easy.."
"1 run, tossed outside off, the batsman ventures down the track, gets close to the pitch, and belts it past the left hand of the bowler. Relays suggest the bowler just finger-tipped it away. Only a harsh man will call it a drop. the bowler, in fact, saved three for his side."
"no run, full outside off again, and driven by Suryakumar off the front foot. The ball was swinging away, and the batsman did well to reach at it. Finds Kohli at cover though."
"no run, drives the low and wide full toss straight to extra cover. Not hit too hard, either, I wonder why."
"no run, sharply cuts in from a back of a length outside off and he punches it away to point."

"1 run, swats a back of a length delivery outside off down to long-on."
"FOUR runs, he's come out with a plan. the batsman walks down the track a touch, uses the shuffle across again and gets close to this length ball pushed wide. Thumps it on the up over mid-off."
"2 runs, short, Umesh hits the middle of the pitch, the batsman is now beaten for pace and bounce. Top-edges a hook into the breeze to the left of deep square leg."
"no run, the bowler hangs it up in the air, dips, and breaks away outside off. the batsman can't connect with the sweep."
"1 run, angles in a length ball from wide of the crease, worked to midwicket."

"1 wide, sees the batsman trying to back away and floats this wide, misses the wide line by a long way.."
"1 run, good length outside off, and Rohit punches off the back foot. Hit with the bat's open face, and comfortably played to third man."
"1 wide, slower ball, but short outside off. the batsman thinks about pulling but chooses not to go through with the shot. Good choice. Earns him an extra run."

"1 run, fuller on middle, bunted down to long-on for one."
"no run, solidly defended off the backfoot."
"1 wide, he loses his line with that slower one, it's gone well outside off."
"no run, around the wicket, and on a good length. Pushed towards cover."
"FOUR runs, reverse sweep, and it's done effortlessly. He knows the bowler wil lbowl on leg stump. And that gives him a leg up. He knows a general area of where the ball will be, he knows third man is up, and he takes advantage."
"1 run, OUT, the batsman can't make it despite the dive! He steered it to short third man where Umesh dived to his right but the ball deflected away, making the batsmen think of two. But it wasn't too far and Umesh qickly got back and, guess what, direct hit at the keeper's end."
"1 run, a googly on middle, waits for the ball to come to him before turning the ball fine to short third man."
"FOUR runs, steps out and slices this over cover. There was long off specifically for the lofted hit, so he just opened the bat face a little to pick the gap. Top shot, bringing all his experience into play."
"1 run, around length outside off, tickled to the leg side with the angle."
"FOUR runs, four more! Back of a length outside off, Suryakumar improvises a late upper cut despite taking his eyes off the ball very early. Somehow he got his periscope of a bat up and ramped the ball over.."
"1 run, drops the length this time. It's wide outside off, and cut furiously to the man in the deep."
"1 run, another cutter, 129 kph, full and wide outside off. the batsman strides forward and slices a drive to deep cover."

"1 run, full-toss angling in on middle, clipped away to deep midwicket off the front foot."
"4 leg byes, did he play a shot? Back of a length down leg, the batsman thinks of playing but bails out of the stroke. The ball ricochets down to fine leg off the pad. The umpire thinks there was a shot.."
"2 runs, goes short first up, helped along behind square for a couple. Not quite in control.."
"FOUR runs, not much room to work with there but the batsman makes up for it by shifting back and subtly opening the face of his bat to knock it through backward of point."
"1 run, backs away and slaps this length ball to deep cover."
"1 run, length ball spinning away from off and he does well not to let it go past him. He's beaten in flight as he steps out but manages to tuck it into the midwicket region."

"1 run, good length on off stump, and the batsman taps it towards long on off the back foot."
"1 run, a bit straighter now, the line, and he clips it down to long-on."
"OUT, finds deep midwicket! It's a short ball. Very short. Turning away from off. the batsman gets behind and wallops this flat to find Chawla out there. He is not happy getting out like that. Could have hit it wide of the fielder without too much effort. A good innings ends."
"1 run, good length outside off, and he rocks back to punch towards deep extra cover."
"no run, slider that  beats the batsman  as he prods forward to defend."
"1 run, short on middle, and the batsman cuts it to Chawla at point. Diving effort stops the ball, and ensures they can only take the single."

"1 run, short of length on off stump, pulled to deep square leg.."
"no run, googly, spins in from a back of a length, and the batsman punches to cover."
"FOUR runs, spears it between short third man and point. These are not shots normally associated with the batsman. Just like he was never meant to get a century with a quick single. So you can understand the bowler going wide yorker. And then going wide-eyed."
"no run, short of a length just outside off, defended to point off the back foot."
"1 run, full outside off, and the batsman gets to the pitch of this delivery. Smothers it off his pads to square leg thereafter."
"no run, steps out but gets yorked nearly as this tails in a long way. AB was more than halfway down the pitch when he was sent back but Buttler doesn't pick up the ball cleanly. Run-out chance missed.."
"1 run, shortish on middle, punched to long on."
"FOUR runs, poor from Tye! What should've been two, has now gone for four. It was punched hard off the back foot past cover, but Tye can't stop it at wide long off."
"SIX runs, the batsman tees off. He nails it into the stands beyond midwicket. Floated up on middle stump, the batsman stretches out and slog-sweeps fiercely."

"1 run, taps the back of length ball outside off nicely and steals a single to keep strike."
"SIX runs, gets under that and sends the ball very very high. Does not quite get the distance. Maxwell circles under the ball,  but he too can't haul the ball back in as he steps over the boundary at long-on."
"1 run, length ball on middle, driven down to long-off."
"no run, good length wide outside off, left alone."

"1 run, right in the block hole outside off, he jams his bat down for a single towards backward point."
"OUT, full on off, and the batsman goes for a wild leg-side heave. Tries to send it over deep midwicket, but comes off the bat's toe end. Billings, at cow corner, takes a few steps in front and completes the catch."
"OUT, mistimes his pull! Straight to midwicket. Short on leg stump, and the batsman was cramped for space. Tried to go through the shot nonetheless, but comes off the bat's top half."
"1 run, shuffles across early and then awkwardly flicks it away to square leg for one."
"1 run, steps out and whips this from outside off towards deep midwicket."
"no run, slower ball, full and wide outside off, and the batsman swings and misses, looking for the long-off boundary. Looked tight, but the umpire decides not to signal wide. Good last over from Mavi, stuck to his plan despite bowling all those wides, and found his rhythm in the end."
"no run, full and outside off, shovelled with the bottom hand to mid-on."
"1 wide, 93 kph, flat down leg, wide. Another extra.."

"1 run, hits the deck hard at length, the batsman punches this towards mid off for a quick single."
"1 run, dropped. Rashid dropped this short and it sat up for the batsman who didn't entirely get hold of his pull. Kaul at deep midwicket goes at it reverse-cupped after getting around it but lets it pop out."
"no run, gets down for a big slog and gets an inside-edge to the back thigh."
"(no ball), flat googly towards the stumps and the batsman defends it back. Oh, no ball for overstepping. Ouch, harsh call from the umpire, Long."
"FOUR runs, in the air and right in the gap on the off side, he gets four too! the batsman backed away again for the short ball and slayed that ball right between extra cover and cover point."
"FOUR runs, Lucky! Hardik'll take it. Good length on off, and his punch towards mid off takes the bat's inside edge. Short fine leg has no chance."
"1 run, full and wide outside off, and the batsman bunts this down the ground to long off."
"1 leg bye, shimmies down the track, but the bowler spots it early, pulls his length back, and doesn't give any room. the batsman tries a flick and is hit on the pads. All he can get is a leg bye."
"2 runs, crunched to sweeper cover, lazy effort in the deep by Tiwary. Looped in a throw, they came back for the second easily."
"SIX runs, sweeps the fast bowler over square leg! Pure audaciousness from the very best in the world. He could block a million balls with a Test on the line. He could get a fifty off 20 odd in a T20, skipping outside off and screwing up the opposition's plans. No country for near yorkers."
"FOUR runs, too short and he's walloped this one bounce to the deep square leg boundary. Picked the length early. Key to the timing was he didn't look to smack this. All timing.."
"1 run, flatter one on middle and leg, punched to deep midwicket."
"1 run, punches this length delivery to sweeper cover."
"no run, full and wide outside off, and Hardik can't connect with the drive. Through to QDK on the full. Excellent ball given the game situation."

"no run, full on middle stump. the batsman almost yorks himself, and squeezes towards the legside."

"FOUR runs, in the air and missed chance. Mayank Dagar dives forward but the ball dips horribly on him and ends up sneaking from underneath to the boundary. A full toss that the batsman shovelled to the deep midwicket region."
"no run, very full and snaking back in, the batsman plays around his front pad - like he had done in the most of his career - cops it on the thigh pad, but this heading down leg."
"1 run, works this full delivery down to long on."
"1 run, overpitched on leg stump, and that's been flicked to fine leg to get off the mark."

"1 run, works this length ball into the leg side for an easy single."
"no run, good length on leg stump, and shapes into his pads. Tries to flick towards the leg side but misses. Hits his front leg, but the lbw appeal is turned down. They're reviewing anyway Is it too high, that's the only question  and yes! Slightly too high. Would've clipped the stumps, but that's umpire's call."
"1 run, good length on middle stump, and tapped to long on for a walking single."
"no run, short and wide outside off. Slashes and misses."
"1 run, back of a length and outside off, flat-batted down to mid-off."
"no run, back of a length and outside off, the batsman lets it go. There is some outswing which gives merit to the one slip in place."
"FOUR runs, full, swinging in, clipped off the pads through midwicket, neatly timed through the gap."
"1 run, googly. Floated up full on leg stump, clipped to deep midwicket."
"1 run, full on off stump, driven to extra cover where Boult - believe it or not - allows it to come on, puts a barrier behind it and fields one with his body completely aligned.."
"1 run, good length on off, and wild spin once again off the surface. Cuts this legspinner to deep extra cover. Gives his brother the strike."
"OUT, taken at long-off and Kings XI win by four runs. Gambhir has his head in his hands. the batsman looks up. A flatter trajectory delivery outside off is chipped away to long-off. Finch takes the reverse-cupped catch and Kings XI begin their celebrations.."
"no run, short on off, and angling away from the batsman. Tries to cut it square, but off the bat's toe end. Trickles away to cover point."
"1 run, slower ball, full on leg stump. But the batsman keeps his eyes on the ball and smothers it with soft hands towards square leg."
"no run, low-arm slider outside off, runs past the bat. Time for the time-out."
"no run, off-stump yorker, slanting in, jabbed back to the bowler."
"FOUR runs, cracked! There's cover and cover point but each one only saw the other's face. No one moved. Length ball, the batsman cleared his front leg and walloped that through the line."
"1 wide, full but too wide outside off. Over the tramlines so that adds another to Rajasthan's total. Rajasthan need 14 off six."

Stunning work from Williamson. the batsman took off early for the run after punching on the up but there wasn't one there."
"1 run, outstanding effort by Stokes to run in from deep midwicket, but takes this on the half-volley. The crowd went up to applaud, but Stokes immediately said no. The ball bobbled out as soon as his elbows hit the ground. This was full and flat on middle, the batsman at the risk of being lbw hit that flat and hard. Full marks for the effort."
"no run, squeezes this full-length delivery to point."
"no run, length ball outside off, mistimes a punch towards the bowler, who lets it go through him but mid-off tidies up."
"2 runs, length on middle stump, shuffles and nudges it between the big space between long-on and deep square."
"FOUR runs, digs it in short again. the batsman is waiting for that and pulls through midwicket for four. Shot.."
"no run,  well bowled!  steps out but the bowler cleverly shortens his length, defended back."
"no run, very full and angling across off, another big swing and a miss. Hooda walks up to the batsman and has a word with him."

"no run, hustles him for pace with a short of length ball on the stumps, the batsman is on the move as he defends back with soft hands."

"SIX runs, is that a six? Yes, it is. the batsman with some timely blows here but have they come too late? Short of a length, he backs away to give himself room and heaves it over cow corner. DD need at least three more of these."
"OUT, toe-ends a lofted hit straight to mid-off.  First IPL wicket for the bowler  and a slower delivery has earned him one. His one-time Karnataka team-mate takes the catch.."
"OUT, the batsman caught the bowler bowled the bowler. Hardik floats a slower offcutter outside off first up. the batsman does not spot it. He is early into a drive and gets more height as opposed to distance. Krunal snuffles the catch at mid-off, has his hands aloft and roars Wakanda forever. Two wickets in three balls for Mumbai."
"1 run, good length and angling into the pads, twirled away through square leg."
"1 run, short on middle, and no real spin this time. Allows Dhawan to stay on the back foot and pull towards deep midwicket."
"no run, gets a good stride forward and defends.."
"no run, good length on off and angling away from the batsman. Sticks his bat out and cuts to point. Diving effort from Agarwal stops the single."
"OUT, holes out to deep midwicket! That's two for the over. Short on middle, and the batsman pulls it hard. Hit well, but doesn't have the distance nor the elevation. Easy catch for Hardik, who takes a few steps forward, and completes the catch. Somebody stop the bowler!."
"SIX runs, high and super handsome. Rashid goes full and the batsman was waiting for it, muscled over the bowler's head, deep into the long-off boundary. This is some hitting.."
"OUT, swept, but straight to Munro in the deep! Full on off, and the batsman doesn't have the power to take it for six. Munro does well to gauge the height, stick his hand out, and then complete the catch."
"no run, back of length outside off, the batsman hangs back and punches it to cover."
"1 run, falls short of third man. They're finding some serious pace off this surface. the batsman steps out and is surprised by the short ball. Looks to hook and gets a leading edge that lands in front of the diving Stanlake."
"no run, a cutter, an offcutter outside off. Nicely timed away to the same fielder.."
"(no ball) 1 run, full-toss above the waist, spliced over the off-side infield."
"no run, misses a full toss. So much for my build up, Mr. CDG. It's juciy, knee-height, with plenty of room outside off and he completely misses it."
"1 run, slower ball, full on middle. Carved towards cover point with soft hands."
"1 run, short and in the corridor. Not enough room on the cut. Rayudu fumbles at backward point and they sneak in a run."
"1 run, the batsman comes down the wicket, and therefore it's a low full toss on off. Driven towards wide long off."
"1 run, back of a length and skids in on middle, punched to long-on."
"no run, full on off stump, and he takes a big stride forward to defend. Tapped back firmly."
"OUT, the batsman goes and with it CSK's hopes? Whippy cutter from Mustafiz, the line is wide of off, the batsman gets more height as opposed to distance. He eventually toe-ends a catch to Suryakumar running in from long-off."
"1 leg bye, good length outside off, and it's the googly to start off. He tries to reverse sweep, but hits his pad. Impact outside off."
"no run, short outside off, the batsman lets hist first ball as KKR captain go to the keeper.."
"1 run, pulled from outside off to deep midwicket."
"no run, it's angled away outside off and the batsman dabs it tentatively to point."
"no run, good length just outside off, and the batsman cuts this square. Played off the front foot, but stopped by Bhuvi at point."
"SIX runs, walks across the stumps and uses his wrists to whip this full delivery over deep midwicket. Stunning. Countered the drift with his wrist work and bottom handed power.  Shades of MS Dhoni and his helicopter shot ."
"1 run, length ball wide outside off, lifts it on the up to extra cover on the bounce."

"no run, back of a length and angling across off, the batsman goes back and steers to point."
"1 run, half-tracker on off stump, and once again heaved towards the leg side off the back foot. Billings is positioned there at cow corner."

"no run, full on off, Rohit drives straight to mid-on."
"OUT, de Villiers takes the batsman! A nice catch. A short, wide delivery outside off. the batsman is too far away from the ball to make adequate contact. All he can do is chip the ball away over cover. But there is enough airtime for AB to run to his left and backwards, his eyes peeled on the ball right through its trajectory and completes the play. Good bowling from the bowler too to bowl that wider."
"no run, appeal for lbw, and a chance for a run out as well! But not given lbw, so the bowler reviews. It was full on off stump, and he tried to slog sweep towards the leg side. It had hit his front leg but would've gone down leg stump. The review's been lost.."
"no run, beaten again. Short and wide outside off, the ball bounces a touch extra too and goes over the bat of the batsman.."
"SIX runs, tossed on off stump, and the batsman punishes this once again! Goes inside out this time, and smacks this over extra cover! KKR are getting hammered here."
"SIX runs, anticipates the slower ball going across him and shuffles right into the off side. Mitch drops this cutter shorter than the others. This means the batsman's momentum moving backwards can be used to spring at the ball as it climbs up at his hips. He duly lofts it over deep backward square."
"no run, excellent use of the short ball, a bouncer on off. the batsman sways out of the line, dot.."
"1 run, shortish outside off, backs away and slaps it out to sweeper cover."

"1 run,  first of the legbreaks from the bowler , turned across the line towards midwicket."
"OUT, the batsman is the third batsman holing out in the 18th over. Back of a length and outside off, the batsman swings across the line but can't clear deep midwicket. He picks out Rohit."
"1 run, gentle little dab into the off side for a quick single.  36th IPL fifty.  Equals Warner's record for most half-centuries in the competition."
"1 run, goes back and across, good reply from the bowler with a yorker outside off near the feet and the batsman drives it bit wide of long on."
"no run, short legbreak, chopped to point."
"2 runs, yorker on middle stump, digs it past the non-striker and comes back easily for the second."
"SIX runs, strays on the pads and Suryakumar lofts the ball over deep backward square leg with a swivel of the wrists. All wrists.."
"OUT,  what a strange way to go.  This was a loose delivery, a half-tracker on middle and leg, the ball took ages to get to the batsman, who was already through with the pull. The ball looped off the back of the bat after it hit the thigh and then to short third man. The missed opportunity doesn't cost KKR much.."
"1 run, flighted outside off, and legspin away from his body. Drives it down the ground to long off to get off the mark."
"1 run, almost run out! He tapped the ball to point and hesitated for a fraction of a second before responding for the single. Iyer went for a direct hit from point but missed it, the batsman had given up on the attempt to make it."
"2 runs, slower ball again. Back of a length outside off, and mistimes the pull again. Comes off the bat's bottom-half and trickles away towards midwicket. The lack of pace behind that shot allows him to come back for another run."
"1 run, full around off, drilled very hard down to long-on."
"SIX runs, back of a length, and in the batsman' slot! Goes onto the back foot, and pulls it over deep midwicket. Off the bat's sweet spot."

"OUT, chops it on! Mavi has the batsman, Delhi has panic! 144kph hour, short and just outside off, in the corridor. the batsman leaps off the ground to try and cut, but it's too close and too quick. He's cramped and he's out.."

"no run, short around off, the batsman goes back and swats one to cover.."

"no run, squirts this to point. Closed the bat face early in trying to nudge this into the leg side.."
"1 run, back of a length outside off, carved to deep point. That is an awesome spell, 1 for 19 in these batting-friendly conditions.."

"1 run, overpitched on middle and leg, and the batsman comfortably flicks it off his pads to midwicket. the bowler keeping it tight."
"FOUR runs, full on middle, and that's just a bit too full for Hardik. Clears his front leg and muscles it over midwicket. Two men in the deep, but bisects both of them."
"2 runs, fullish length, flicked off the pads through midwicket."
"no run, tidy start from Dhawal. On a length, around middle, some away shape. Defended to mid-on. No golden duck this time.."
"no run, nicely done. Bouncer at an off stump line. the batsman backs away again to try and slice over slip. Well beaten."
"FOUR runs, the batsman wins this battle. the bowler offers a full toss on off stump, the batsman probably smirks internally as he bludgeons this straight down the ground."
"1 run, good length outside off, and the batsman cuts it square to the man in the deep."
"no run, excellently bowled. That has to be one bouncer for the over? IT IS. The first one I've seen today. Follows the batsman, just beaten."

"1 run, picked off the pads to deep midwicket."
"FOUR runs, half-tracker on off, and that's just way too easy for Watto. Rides the bounce and smacks this pull as square as one can imagine. Neither deep midwicket nor deep backward square can intercept."
"no run, beaten. Another googly. This one spinning into the corridor from back of a length. He goes for the late cut - even though a slip is there - and misses."
"no run, floats this full and slants this across, defended from the crease towards cover point."

"1 run, full on off, and driven with the turn down to wide long on."
"OUT, back of a length on middle, but the batsman makes a lot of room on the leg side. Pulls it towards the leg side, but Krunal takes a screamer! He's at short fine leg, but needs to race towards the square-leg boundary. Dives forward, and takes an excellent catch!."

"FOUR runs, too wide outside off, it's even gone beyond the wide line but Curran reaches out for the full delivery and slams it flat and wide of long off for four."
"2 runs, good length outside off, and punched off the back foot. Deep extra cover, Mohit Sharma, puts in a sliding effort."

"no run, good length outside off, and spinning away from the batsman. Tries to slog-sweep but can't connect. The umpire doesn't think it's a wide either."

"SIX runs, very full and veering into the pads, the batsman picks it up, twirls his wrists and lifts it over midwicket. He exploits the short leg-side boundary, again."
"1 run, dropped! Again! That's the batsman's third life of the game as he takes on a slower ball, on a length on middle, and tries to launch it over midwicket. The lack of pace messes with his timing. The height the ball goes messes with the fielder Agarwal."
"no run, flat to start off. On middle stump, and the batsman defends it back to the bowler."

"no run, good length on the fourth-stump line. the batsman tries to pull, but mistimes it to midwicket. Off the bat's toe end."

"1 run, short of a length, angled in at middle and leg, punched to long-on."
"OUT, bottom-edged to the keeper! The knuckle ball earns him the wicket. Full and wide outside off, and the batsman actually followed him to the off side, but the ball's too low and it takes a feather edge. An excellent innings comes to an end."

"1 run, both batsmen are at the same end! Anderson races through the moment the batsman glides the short ball to point. But the batsman himself is not terribly keen. Then he changes his mind and goes for the run. But wait, by that point Anderson realises he should get back to the non-strikers' end and all of that culminates with both he, the batsman and the bowler the bowler waiting on the fielder. The throw is poor, even the bowler can't save its blushes. And so, Anderson has the chance to complete the single he so dearly wanted."
"FOUR runs, freebie! Full toss on off, and the batsman backs away to thump it over cover! Wide long off does not bother moving an inch."

"1 run, OUT, full and wide, dragged off the inside half to wide long-on. Another slower ball, Axar can't manufacture his own pace and he risks a second. He is late, and eventually dishes out a full-length dive. Binny throws it to the keeper, who takes the bails off. Is the bat on the line? Or is there some part behind the line? No conclusive evidence. Tight call for the TV umpire. Bardue rules Axar out. Excellent throw from Binny: right on top of the stumps."
"OUT, Is Maxwell out? Yes!  How unlucky would he have to be? It was full on middle stump, and the batsman drove it straight to the bowler. The bowler managed to get fingertips to it, and it ricocheted onto his boots and then onto the stumps. Maxwell's too slow to react, and he's inches short of the ground.."

"no run, slower length ball, slapped to cover."
"no run, full and a hint of late swing away. But he's behind this as he drives to mid-on."

"no run, full on leg stump, and that's been swept! Only to Fizz at short fine leg, though."

"1 run, clipped off the pads to fine leg."
"no run, reverse-sweeps this time from middle and leg, straight to short third man."

"no run, slower ball, on a good length. Punched down the ground - past the bowler - to mid on."
"OUT, and given! LBW. But the batsman wants to review. That was the drifter. Sliding in through the air, pitches in front of middle and hits him in front of middle. That's relatively plumb. He missed a big sweep that he attempted, the ball was too full to play that stroke. No bat on that. Two reds and juuuust clipping the side of leg stump. A smile on umpire Shamsuddin's face. That was close.."

"1 run, length delivery on the stumps, the batsman makes some room and pushes into the covers."

"no run, starts with a swervy away carrom ball that is fiercely struck to point."

"1 run, full, flicked powerfully off the pads to deep midwicket."

"no run, not much room but he drives anyway, hit straight to cover."

"no run, shapes to play a full-blooded drive but is drawn well forward, still can't get to the pitch of the ball. Gets a thick inside edge onto the ground. Was very close to the boot even as Karthik took the catch and asked for the umpires to check upstairs. The soft signal was not-out. Replays confirm the ball clearly hit the pad-boot and bounced before Karthik grabbed that. Straightforward decision for the TV umpire.."
"1 run, excellent yorker to start the over. Aimed at his toes, and all the batsman can do is nudge it to Mayank at deep midwicket."

"1 run, squeezes this length ball towards point, the batsman is on a mission to not just hit boundaries but pinch ones and twos as well."
"SIX runs, there is no one better in cricket at the 1-2. If one is full, he expects the next one short. He did that to Rashid Khan, a bowler that has owned T20s recently. He's done that to the bowler, knows that the bowler will be slow and full. So he runs down and drills a drive right back. What batting. Awesome."

"1 run, a slower ball on middle, pushed to long-on for a run."

"1 run, nice flight, lands this at length on off stump, eased wide of cover."
"1 run, yorker on middle stump, and Hardik does well to squeeze it down the ground. Kohli at long on."
"1 leg bye, cuts in from a shortish length, the batsman gets the batsman on the hip as he tries to work it away with a cross-batted whip."
"SIX runs, that is maaaasive! Wheee goes the ball over long-on. It's a 116 kph offcutter outside off, and by now it's predictable. the batsman shuffles across, gets underneath the length and says not every ball, mate. Pummeled over long-on.."
"FOUR runs, drops it too short and is punished. Attempted offcutter but there's a lot of time to adjust. Reaches out and steers it wide of short fine."

"1 run, good length on off, and angling into the batsman. Slogs it towards the leg side, but men there in the deep."
"no run, back of a length on off, and the batsman tries to work it towards the leg side. Mistimes it, and the ball ricochets onto his own pads."
"FOUR runs, short and wide, that's too much room, and the batsman carves it away through the vacant third man region."
"2 runs, dropped by Ashwin running back from mid-off! He moves a little slowly, perhaps because he has to keep track of the ball over his shoulder. Reaches out in desperation and ends up fluffing a mostly straightforward chance. And so the batsman gets a reprieve. Dude plays sweet shots, and then loses his head straight after. Like here, when he looks to take on a good length ball on off stump and lift it over mid-on. Not the shot to play on this pacy pitch."
"no run, short on off and goes with the slower ball to the batsman. He's in two minds, and eventually wants to ramp it past the keeper, but misses completely."
"OUT, picks out Rashid Khan in the deep! No, correction - Rashid Khan picks him up in the deep!

"FOUR runs, 116 kph. A slower delivery down leg, the batsman pulls that, but gets the ball behind square for a boundary. Over fine leg. He's too early through the shot, but he won't care. Four.."
"1 run, slow outside off, some flight, but it isn't full. Very clever delivery. Worked against the spin, to midwicket.."

"no run, short of a length slider outside off, can't get bat on the cut."

There was intent right from the outset.."
"1 run, a slower delivery, 117 kph, worked away to deep square leg for one."

"FOUR runs,  Now off the backfoot!  Splits backward point and short third man. Picked the length early - mind you, this wasn't all that short - he rocked back and cracked that away.."
"1 run, wide outside off, and even a full toss. But the batsman misses out. His slap towards point comes off the bat's toe end. Lucky the bowler."
"SIX runs, slogged over long on! Slower ball, gives it just a bit more air, and the full ball is in the batsman's arc. Gets down on one knee, and smacks this over the non-striker's head."
"no run, shorter and angling away outside off, guided with the angle to backward point."
"no run, shapes away late. This is much fuller and starts off from middle, KW is squared up a touch as he defends.."

"2 runs, slower ball, full on middle stump. All the batsman can do is drive towards long on for a single."

"no run, slower ball on middle, the batsman blocks."
"no run, same delivery this time, beaten for pace and room as he swings and misses."
"FOUR runs, that's not great bowling. It's short and wide with third man in. Kishan slices a cut between short third man and backward point. Too easy. Poor over that one. One too many from Rahane.."

"OUT, Is that the game?! Full on off, and Hardik drills it straight to long on. Dives forward and takes an excellent tumbling catch. What a change in attitude though. Kohli took a similar catch two nights ago, but didn't show any emotion that evening. Today he's ecstatic."

"OUT, run-out! Terrible from Sunrisers. They've had a shocking evening. A slower ball outside off, the batsman finally gets bat on it. Slices a drive to point. Hardik Pandya misfields, which makes the batsman think there is a single. Pathan comes running down, sees Pandya's throw is coming and returns back to his crease, allowing the batsman to sacrifice himself. The ball pops out of Kishan's gloves, just as he made contact with the stumps."

"no run, slower length ball across the batsman, who defends to cover."
"FOUR runs, oh there's life here still. Just about. Short of a length ball in at the hips. the batsman swings cleanly and connects to drag this to fine leg's left. The slide won't help, it's four."

"1 run, back of a length and outside off, guided to third man."

Just about. the batsman steps out against the googly and is too close to it despite getting to the pitch of it at a good length in front of off.

"(no ball), 100.9ks dart, fizzes off the pitch, beats the inside edge and hits the back pad. Might have headed past leg stump. Front-foot no-ball from the bowler. He's feeling the pressure."
"SIX runs, half-volley on the pads, the batsman loves it there, he picks it up and flicks it up and over backward square for a flat six."
"1 run, mishit. Wanted to drive this flighted off-stump ball through the covers, was a touch early on it and ended up dragging it out to deep midwicket."
"1 run, a touch fuller and he goes back in the crease again to cut it square."

"OUT, Awful mix-up between the wickets, and the batsman has been dismissed. This was on a length and outside off, hint of turn, the batsman stretches out and pushes it to the right of Watson at short cover. He goes for an non-existent single, he is halfway down the pitch, Pant sends him back. Not enough time to undo his steps. Dhoni delays taking the bails off. Bring on Thanos, please."
"1 run, tossed on the pads, worked square on the leg side for one."

"no run, drags this sweep from outside off to short fine. This was fired full outside off by the bowler. Pressure building?."

"2 runs, in the air, and a moment of excitement as the ball lobs in the air. Not very well-timed and it lands short of long-off."
"OUT, McCullum takes the catch at backward point. It's a bad shot, short and wide, the ball moving away, the batsman looks to swat the ball over midwicket but it's the wrong shot. A cut would have been a better shot. But he chose the pull and to add to that, he's hurries on the shot. So the ball takes the splice and lobs up.."
"1 wide, yikes. Bouncer very short, pitching outside leg, and sliding further down."
"OUT, is that it? Yes it is! Deepak Hooda not in the XI today, but he has the opportunity to be on the field for a very, very famous moment. Gets under it at midwicket and completes a catch. Mustafiz looks to pull and gets it off the high part of the bat. A slice - no danger. Mumbai's innings was no danger, to be fair. A feeble end but a fitting one."

"1 run, yes, they can! Full on off stump, and the batsman drives it over the non-striker's head to long off. What an excellent final over from the bowler. Can he finish off well?."
"OUT, goes short outside off, and the batsman's pull takes the top edge! Hardik gets under it, and manages to keep his composure."
"OUT, he's feathered an edge and RCB are on a freefall. Not the right length to pull, looked to fetch from outside off, and just got the bottom edge. The umpire didn't give it initially but raised his finger as he saw Moeen walking. Moeen's maiden IPL outing with the bat is a forgettable one!."
"1 run, low full toss at 146kmh, driven hard and fast to mid off where birthday boy Russell dives and saves a few."
"1 run, good length just outside off. No spin this time as it zips straight through. Chopped to short third man from way close to his body."
"OUT, bounced out! Because the batsman isn't prepared for it to kick up off the pitch as it does. He sees the ball pitching short, believes there is enough room on offer for the pull, goes through with the shot, but only splices it to mid-off. Ashwin takes a simple catch. Kings XI draw first blood.."
"no run, back of a length first up to the batsman. Superb accuracy from the bowler, which forces the batsman to defend off the back foot."
"FOUR runs, hoicked from outside off, gets this one bounce into the ropes at deep square leg. Dragged this a long way, lucky to get away with it.."
"1 run, a cutter on middle, pushed to cover for one. Roy and the bowler collide. But the run is easily done.."

"no run, dot ball! Another cutter outside off, another swat, another swing and miss.."
"1 run, punches this length delivery into the deep extra cover region."

"no run, another leading edge. Slow on middle and leg, gets some turn too. Off the top edge towards midwicket."
"1 run, dropped! Kohli has his face covered at slip as M Ashwin puts down a sitter at extra cover. the bowler has done superbly to induce a leading edge from the batsman -  a dipping legbreak at off stump that he looks to lift over midwicket. There was no pressure on Ashwin, apart from anything he put on himself. He got under it, couldn't complete it."
"no run, full and angling across off stump, the batsman lets it go in the channel."
"FOUR runs, slower ball, but overpitched on leg stump. Too easy for the batsman who uses his long levers to whip this over midwicket. No one in the deep there."

"1 run, short enough for the batsman to stay back and punch it square for one."

"no run, slow bouncer, it beats the batsman completely. Can't get close."

"FOUR runs, another slower ball, it's full and the batsman picks it to flick it with those mighty wrists, it's going fast towards the midwicket boundary where Billing dives to keep it in, but the ball is rolling towards the boundary again and we have the third umpire looking at it.

"no run, bat-pad, or pad-bat?! Full on off, and zipping straight through. The batsman tries to defend, and hits his pad first, perhaps. the bowler wants to review. Interesting. It's definitely pad first, but is it turning away too much? Yes, just too much. Missing off stump by a whisker!."
"1 run, slides it into the pads, and the batsman uses the angle and spin to tuck behind square."
"1 run, good length on middle, and straightens after pitching. Slight adjustment from the batsman, as he gets inside the line of the ball, and then simply nudges it towards square leg."

"1 run, length on middle, flicked to deep midwicket."
"1 run, on the pads, worked away to deep square leg."
"no run, fires it through on middle and leg and strikes the batsman on the pads. Big shout for lbw but it would have gone down leg."

"1 wide, strays waaaaay down leg. A wide to a right-hander.."
"OUT, a first-ball duck for the batsman. He comes down, looking to work the ball into the leg side. But he walks far across while looking to find his first run. The ball, a nothing delivery on off, clips the back of his front pad and then ricochets into the off stump. Not been a great start to the IPL for the batsman.."
"1 run, driven through the line to sweeper cover."
"1 run, good length outside off, and spinning into him. Punched to long on for a walking single."
"1 run, slips in a yorker that has been flicked nicely into the gap at deep square. Big mix-up again between Pant and Harshal, but he's managed to turn back in time at the non-striker's end."
"1 wide, slow bouncer, it bounces so much that the batsman lets it go over him for a wide."
"1 run, a short slower ball outside off, hit away to long-off. the batsman isn't happy with the execution.."
"1 run, punches this length ball on the up to long off. the batsman wanted the second, Pant didn't. Cry of anguish from the skipper. Remember the run out from the other night?."
"OUT, the bowler has his hands aloft in delight. the batsman attempts to clear short fine leg. No dice. He shows his ace early and shuffles across off stump. Mustafiz chases him with a short ball that gets big on the batsman. He miscues a scoop to Krunal Pandya. Not sure if the batsmen crossed over."
"FOUR runs, length ball outside off, not much spin into hhim, and the batsman gets down to split the short third man region with a reverse sweep."

"1 run, long-hop on off stump, pulled hard and flat, on the bounce to Stokes at deep midwicket."

"1 run, flat and quick on middle and leg, pushed to long-on for one. Another tidy over.."
"no run, ends with another yorker. Straight at middle stump, and the batsman does well to get bat to ball. Mistimed to backward point."

"no run, walks outside the crease and bunts this length delivery to cover again."
"FOUR runs, the bowler goes very full on off stump, 141.5ks, Parthiv picks it up and simply chips it in the air over midwicket for back-to-back fours."
"1 run, length on leg stump, nudged to deep square off the front foot."
"FOUR runs, back of a length and wide outside off, the batsman reaches out, opens the face and glides it away in the gap at point. Finesse from the batsman."

"1 run, full and outside off, eased to long-off off the front foot."
"1 run, yorker just outside off, and dug away towards cover for a walking single."
"no run, good length on off, and spinning into the batsman. Punched to cover."
"FOUR runs, outrageous! He walks down the pitch, the bowler tops him by shortening his length, but the batsman says I'm good enough to still hit down the ground. Stands up taller, that bottom hand grips the bat tighter and he somehow gets on top of the bounce to clear mid-on."
"FOUR runs, the batsman still can't get hold of his shots but he'll get four for this. A slow short of a length delivery that he backs away to and manages to chip over the in-field at the cover and point region."
"1 run, hops back and tucks this length ball off his hip to square leg."

"1 run, a full, wide delivery is awkwardly slogged to long-on for one.."
"no run, low full toss on middle stump, and that's been blocked back to the bowler. Straight back to the bowler, who thinks about having a shy at the stumps. Surprised the batsman there."

"FOUR runs, a nod of appreciation from Rohit. It's too full again and Suryakumar nails his drive right back, a lovely, languid drive past mid-off's right."
"no run, ah, has he got away with that? Seemed to drift a long way from the left-hander, nowhere near the batsman's reach, but for some reason, the umpire thought that was fine."
"no run, short outside off, and DK mistimes his pull. Straight to square leg."

"no run, the batsman slinks away outside leg, shorter on middle, bounces over the bat."
"no run, good length on middle, and he can only tap it towards mid on this time. Man there."

"FOUR runs, knuckle ball on off, and the batsman's through his straight drive way too early. Mistimes it between Bhuvi and the non-striker, but reaches the long-on boundary."
"FOUR runs, another leg-sidish delivery. CSK can ill-afford this. Angled into his pads and Suryakumar gets on his toes before tucking it off the pads behind square."
"OUT, Southee pulls off an incredible hokey-pokey catch at the edge of the long-on boundary. He leaps back, catches the ball, goes past the boundary. But then drops the ball into play before going beyond the fence. Then comes back and pouches it with both hands. the batsman hangs at the edge of the straight boundary, but he has to go. The TV umpire confirms that's a clean catch. Well done, Southee. Umesh banged it short and outside off, the batsman, having backed away outside leg, attempts a pull and ends up dragging a catch. That it was a catch was down to Southee's brilliance. What a play."
"no run, just past the bat's outside edge! Full on off, and angling across the batsman. Tried to open the bat's face and run it fine, but the ball zipped past his blade and through to Kishan. Could've easily taken the outside edge."
"1 run, fullish on middle stump, gets forward to clip it away through square leg."
"2 runs, drilled back past the bowler, no chance for mid off. K Gowtham hared around the ropes from long on to put out a diving stop. Super stuff. Saved three runs. I just think both batsmen assumed that will be a boundary.."
"1 run, plants the front foot across for a sweep to deep fine leg."
"SIX runs, full on off stump, and the batsman's slog sweeps this over Rahul's head. Looked like he sliced it, and that's flying over long on. Pure muscle."
"no run, gets down for a big sweep to a completely wrong length and line. Not full by any means and slanted a long way across."
"no run, run-out appeal at the non-striker's end. the batsman has taken the stumps down at the other end but the bowler hasn't got a hand on it. Billings it looking for a run though as the ball deflects towards the bowler who now has to run back at the stumps and uproot them with ball in hand. Manages it but Billings' dive saves him."

"1 run, fullish length, spins in from outside off, and the batsman flicks to midwicket."
"no run, knuckle ball? In any case, it deviates away from the right-hander, and rather late too. the batsman is playing in front of his body, with a closed bat face, and gets a leading edge."
"no run, good length outside off, looks to drive on the up but is beaten. Bat was well inside the line of that one."
"1 run, works this wide of midwicket."

"1 run, on off stump, and that's been comfortably flicked off the front foot to the gap on the leg side."
"1 leg bye, good length on middle, and misses the leg-side flick. Hits his pad and dribbles away to square leg."

"no run, good length outside off, and the batsman defends it away. Bhuvi starts off with two slips."

"SIX runs, another offcutter, but he drags it down and it ends up as a half-tracker to swat away like a mischievous fly over midwicket. When it comes to roles for T20 sides, does the batsman do it better than everyone else?."
"no run, the googly, on middle and off, blocked back."
"1 run, again late on the shot. Back of a length on middle, pulled away towards long-on, but on the bounce to the fielder.."

"no run, shuffles across and blocks a length ball."

"1 run, walks right across, worked away to deep square leg for a run.."
"OUT, the batsman walks! Good length outside off, and the ball stays slightly low. Tries to cut square but the ball goes under his bat. Takes a feather edge, and DK collects like a boss! They don't even bother appealing since the CSK captain starts to walk. Fair-play points, please!."
"1 run, length ball around leg, worked to deep square leg for a run."
"no run, full just outside off, and defended off the back foot."

"no run, full at leg stump, bunted to mid-on."
"no run, 140 kph, full and swinging back in, Kishan gets forward and somehow defends. It's a similar delivery to what Umesh bowled to him at the Wankhede.."
"FOUR runs, short, flat, quick, but does not bounce as much as the batsman expected it to. the batsman shapes for the pull but adjusts superbly to the lack of bounce. He shovels it with the bottom hand and summons enough power. What was more remarkable was that he found the gap between deep midwicket and wide long-on."
"no run, almost chopped on! Good length just outside off, and the batsman tries to punch towards cover. The ball comes just into him, and takes the inside of his bat. Lucky he didn't play that on."

"1 run, skids one through on off stump, punched to Jadeja at deep point."
"no run, appeal for caught behind, but not given! What did that touch, the Mumbai players wonder, but they choose not to review. Good length on middle and zipping straight through. the batsman tried to flick it square off his pads, but the ball missed his bat and took the top of his pads."
"1 wide, shapes to pull but this got big on him, umpire thinks way over the batsman's head. Wide called."
"1 run, short and wide outside off, but takes the pace off it again. DK crunches another cut, but the fielder at deep point came in there after the last ball."

"FOUR runs, short offbreak on middle, the batsman goes deep in the crease and middles a pull to the left of deep square leg."

"1 run, low full-toss on off, clubbed away to wide long-on."
"1 wide, starts the inswinger too straight again. Strays down leg, wide!."

"no run, full on middle stump, and that's been pushed off the front foot towards cover. Sky doesn't want the run."
"1 run, full on middle, and the batsman comes down the ground. Hits through the ball's line, and the shot goes one-bounce to long on."
"SIX runs, knuckle ball on off, but the batsman's spotted the length early. Big stride forward and muscled over the bowler's head. Lands beyond the sightscreen. Full use of the free hit!."

"1 run, full outside off, and driven with the bat's open face to the man in the deep."

"OUT, Yuvraj is gone? He's walking back! the batsman played that quietly towards point and called Yuvraj through for a non-existent single. The fielder at point runs in, throws the ball back to the keeper and Yuvraj is welllll short of the crease. In backyard cricket, when you want the other person to get out, you call them for a run that isn't there and just say, sorry mate, next batsman. That's how bad that call for a single was."
"FOUR runs, slider just outside off, the batsman uses the pace of Rashid and scoops it over the head of the keeper."
"no run, excellent delivery! Short on leg stump, and going away from the batsman. The angle's difficult for the batsman, and he misses the pull again."
"OUT, back of a length on middle, and the batsman goes for a pull. It's been sliced though, and Bumrah gets under it at deep square leg! The ball was swirling in the air, so extra marks for that effort. KKR losing wickets in a clump once again."
"no run, good length on off, and once again spinning wildly after hitting the surface. Hardik's in no place to punch it towards cover."
"1 wide, slows it down this time, letting the ball drift into the pads. This time the ball slides through without turning to the wicketkeeper."
"FOUR runs, quicker, on middle stump. It's angling down the leg side however, and all the batsman has to do is drag it fine. Flicked very fine, and between the keeper and short third man. Hat-trick of boundaries."

"1 run, top work from Mandeep at point, diving to his left to stop a cut shot that might rival a bazooka for power."

"5 runs, overthrows. the batsman dabs a length ball into the leg side and Karthik slides, swivels and throws a very very wide throw as he tries to run the batsman out at the other end. Russell puts in a big dive to the left at mid-off but can't stop that."
"OUT, waist high full toss outside off, and the batsman thumps it towards the leg side. Straight down deep midwicket's throat, but the batsman thinks it could be a no ball. They're checking. It's gonna be close, but given!."

"1 run, quietly turned with the incoming angle to the leg side for one."
"OUT, taken at short fine. Binny pedals backwards and falls awkwardly on his back, but he's held on with the reverse cup. Another ungainly hoick by the batsman against a googly he hasn't picked. More a sweep, in fact. Regulation top-edge taken at 45."
"FOUR runs, just helped along. A googly that pitches around leg and spins away further down that line and all the batsman has to do is put bat to ball to work it away through fine leg."
"SIX runs, shot! What a shot! Umesh offers a length ball in the corridor, with all his pace. the batsman is grateful for it on this slow pitch. Stands tall, merely taps from under this and sends it over long-off."
"no run, arm ball, slides in, played back to the bowler."
"no run, back of a length, angling in, straightening away to beat the outside edge near the higher part of the bat."

What a way to bring up a fifty. the batsman pumps his fists as he acknowledges the dugout. Kohli applauds. Three sixes on the bounce for the batsman. How the match has turned."
"1 run, googly, pushed flat at a length outside off. Mistimed sweep along the floor to deep midwicket's right."
"SIX runs, it's the batsman's turn, he's sent that over the cow corner! Short enough from the bowler for the batsman to go back quickly and pull that to the leg side. It's a short boundary and they're making full use of it."

"no run, loads up the sweep, but he's through the shot - Rassshiiiid . his ability to change the pace in accordance to the desperation of the batsman is just unreal. The ball jumps over the top edge, lobs off the shoulder and then to slip."

"SIX runs, the batsman has top-edged it and fetches a six. Chest-high short ball outside off, the batsman can't get on top of the bounce. He swings his hands at a pull anyway and skies it to Mars. It drops down beyond the wide long-on boundary."
"no run, back of a length and outside off, the batsman reaches out for the ball and edges it onto the ground. The ball hits Parthiv's foot."

Tried to flat-bat this over mid on, with the ball angling into the batsman' body, but he's through his shot too early, and comes off the toe end.

"2 runs, full and outside off, drives smoothly through to the sweeper cover."
"OUT, taken. the batsman gets the front leg into the leg side to set up for the slog. Never a good strategy against the bowler's away drifters. It's going too far away and he gets a thin edge that carries to Buttler. A sensational innings from the batsman ends."

"3 runs, full and straight, the batsman sweeps it flat and hard to the right of deep midwicket. Billings tears to his right, slides, knocks the ball away.

But here he is, taking out the Bradman of T20 cricket, with an honest to goodness super dooper bouncer. It's quick. Its from around the wicket. It comes at his chest. The pull shot malfunctions. Top edge straight up and Thampi takes the catch himself somewhere around short leg."
"no run, beaten by the googly. Shaped to steer this past the keeper but pulled out."
"no run, the batsmen must feel like this pitch can't make up its mind. To the quicks, it's fast and bounce. To the spinners, it keeps stopping. the batsman, here, all set to punch through cover, gets an inside edge back to the bowler."

"1 run, belts this down the ground, on the bounce to Pandey at long on. May have flirted with the idea of trying to take this."
"OUT, pre-meditated from the batsman, and he pays the price. Doesn't make an effort to suss out the length and just charges down the track. It's a little too shortish for his comfort and skids on at pace along a leg-sidish line before clattering into the stumps."
"OUT, another run-out chance, Hardik may not have collected the ball here! the batsman steered the ball to point and DK wanted the single, he hared out and turned back too. Oh hello, that's so so close. Hardik's right hand is in front of the stumps as the throw comes in and looks like the hand has broken the stumps as it comes back to collect the ball.

"no run, another wrong'un, thrusts his bat in front of the pad in defence."
"1 run, googly, short of a length and going away from off stump. Gets on the back foot and tickles it through square leg."
"2 runs, good length on off, but KW backs away towards the leg side. Carves it square with soft hands, which allows them to come back for the second."
"1 wide, OUT, leg-side stumping! the batsman loses his balance completely. It's a slider down leg side that keeps going away from him as he walks down the pitch for some reason. Has to reach out a long way for the flick and he won't get there. Karthik's toughest task there is gathering the ball. He does that properly and then the stumping is relatively easy."
"1 wide, slides this down leg, beaten. Rahul fumbles.."
"no run, tossed up just a shade outside off, the batsman presses forward and runs it back to the bowler."

"FOUR runs, thick outside edge that beats short third man. Looks to slice this behind point but the ball dips and takes the edge.."
"SIX runs, down the track, right to the pitch, and smoked over long-on. Overcompensation from the bowler as he flights it up too much."
"FOUR runs, dismisses it to the boundary - he was eyeing midwicket, but he'll settle for extra cover. Mr 360 at his very best, starting things off by moving across outside off to open up the leg side. But Harshal one-ups him by bowling wide, as far wide as he dares. But the batsman raises the game with a blistering lofted drive for his fifty, off only 24 balls."
"2 runs, makes room and drives inside out to deep extra cover, the batsman scampers back. Can the batsman get to his half-century? He's played beautifully.."

"1 run, length on middle stump, walks down the pitch and chips it towards long-on."
"1 run, good length on leg stump, clipped off his pads to deep backward square. Keeps strike."
"SIX runs, gets to the pitch, doesn't get too close, but gets underneath. Enough of getting. He then executes. Drilled over the bowler's head for six. Straight. Superb hit.."
"no run, hardly moves his feet and steers the ball straight to point."
"OUT, the bowler has the last laugh! Tossed up on middle, and the batsman has no option but to slog sweep. Connected well, but doesn't have the distance. It's the longer part of the boundary on the leg-side, and therefore perishes for 45."
"no run, good length outside off, and the batsman goes onto the back foot to punch towards cover. No nerves for the bowler."
"no run, a slower ball outside off, tapped to point. Played in front of square.."
"no run, he's hitting those drives and pulls so well, tries a reverse paddle now and misses."

"no run, good length on middle stump, but angling across the batsman. Shoulders his arms this time."

"1 run, short of a length on off, and a rare quick single from the batsman as he drops it to the left of point and takes off."
"1 bye, goes for a mighty heave, misses. Wasn't far from off stump. Lost shape, bottom hand came off the bat handle. This was a googly too.."
"1 run, full just outside off, tries to drive towards cover, but takes the inside edge. The ball goes towards midwicket instead."
"2 runs, belts this full delivery to Pandey at long off, this time they hare back for the second. Almost as if Iyer said ""don't care what you do, just get back.""."
"1 run, full outside leg stump again, smothered with the spin and pushed down the ground to long on."
"OUT, finds long-on. Knuckle ball on a length at off stump. Gets under it and puts in a clean swing. But it's off the low part of the bat."
"OUT, and there ends the batsman's underwhelming stay. Full and angled across, and that drift does him in as he skews it in the air off the outside of the bat with Ashwin is waiting under it at extra cover."
"no run, slower ball, back of a length on off stump. Backs away and pushes straight to extra cover."
"no run, short ball on off stump, but stays terribly low! Defended off the back foot."
"no run, has it bounced? Ground-boot or boot and air? A flat delivery outside off, the batsman chops the ball into hos leg, the ball pops up. Kishan dives full length to his right and take the catch full. The soft signal is out, but that's the wrong decision because the ball has hit the ground.."
"1 run, flatter and fuller on middle stump, pushed down to long-off."
"2 runs, nice and full outside off, the batsman stretches out, meets the pitch, and rolls out a sweep between deep midwicket and deep square leg."
"1 run, another googly outside off, drilled down to long-off."
"SIX runs, speared outside off, Kishan drags it in the air, Jadeja, who is a few yards in as opposed to staying at the edge of the boundary, can't collect it. Kishan clears him."
"1 run, full on leg stump, the batsman takes care not to hit across the line and finds a single at mid-on."

"1 run, on a length and outside off, run down to third man."
"no run, length ball on off, driven to extra cover."
"1 run, yorker just outside off, and that's been squeezed away to short third man. The fielder does well to adjust for the spin and stops it with one hand."
"no run, superb delivery from the bowler. the batsman premeditated the full delivery so he went across, looking to chip the ball over fine leg. But it's a sharp bouncer aimed at the wide tramline, which means it's extremely well directed.."
"no run, the batsman steps out again, the bowler hits the pitch hard and goes shorter, 139.9ks, jabbed back to the bowler."
"1 wide, goes towards the off stump and the bowler strays down leg for a wide."
"FOUR runs, put away for four. A low full toss down leg, can't bowl full tosses at this time. Flicked away through backward square leg for four. Easily done.."
"1 run, stays back inside the crease and pulls this down to deep fine leg."
"1 run, full on leg, and the batsman comfortably glances this fine down the leg side. Man in the deep though."
"no run, full on off, and he tries to drive towards cover. Takes the inside edge and trickles down to short fine leg. Darting throw from the fielder to the non-striker's, but Kishan's safe."
"OUT, leading edge lobs up for point. This seems to be the worst delivery of the over on first glance. Full ball outside leg stump, not a lot of swing on it. Surely going wide if he doesn't attempt a shot, surely there for a tickle if he stays in the crease. But the batsman decides to walk down the pitch to cut out all the swing he's been seeing. Reaches out for it outside leg and is through the shot early. Easy take for Pandey."
"1 run, skids on just a shade outside off, the batsman camps back and punches a single down to long-on."

"2 runs, full and wide outside off, flayed wide of sweeper cover for two."
"OUT, gone. the batsman has picked out long-off and that's the game. Fails to get hold of this fullish ball. Doesn't help that it's curving into him and he doesn't get the room he's looking for as a result. Chips it straight into the hands of long-off."
"FOUR runs, wallops the back of a length ball outside off over mid-off. Roy is the man haring after it, hoping to drag it back, throwing himself head-first at the ball. It's travelled too far, and he might have hurt himself from the effort. He's on his haunches with a crowd around him, talking to Chris the bowler and the physio. Roy has gone off the field."
"1 run, length ball, spinning in on middle, tucked to square leg."

"1 run,  second win of the season for Mumbai Indians!  They're still alive in the competition. The scorecard may suggest a last-over win but this has been a very comprehensive one. Uses the pace to steer this past short third man. Too easy.  Just the second loss for CSK ."

"no run, full on leg stump, cramps the batsman for room, worked to the leg side."

"1 wide, awry delivery! Waist-high on middle stump and goes down the leg side. More extras."
"OUT, taken at short third man! Another indicator that the batsman did not read Piyush the bowler. A legbreak on middle and off, the batsman looks for a reverse sweep, takes a thick leading edge and lobs to short third man. Legspin comes with extra revolutions and very very often top edges too.."
"1 run, good length on off, and that's been tapped to backward point. the batsman scampers across to the other end, but more important, gives the strike back to Billings."
"1 wide, bangs in a bouncer at 143, too high and called wide."

"1 run, gets up close and personal with another slower ball, this time on middle, and pulls to deep midwicket."
"no run, insists he has taken the catch and Samson might just have turned the game with a one-handed stunner! The on-field officials take it to the third umpire, but the soft signal is not out. First replays indicate the ball might just have touched the turf before Samson scoops it up. So the batsman can heave a sigh of relief and think about improving on that cut shot. He did make room to try and get the gap to the left of point. And almost managed it too.."
"no run, very full outside off, the batsman walks across early and then ends up wearing it on the pad as the ball rolls away to short fine leg."

"1 run, shuffles across and punches out to sweeper cover."
"SIX runs, hasn't started well. This has been pulled into the deep square leg boundary with some style and nonchalance. Rohit picked the length early and allowed his timing to do the rest.."
"2 runs, another yorker on leg stump, of course. Dug away towards midwicket, and no one's there in the deep. the bowler has to go racing behind it, and does well to keep it down to only two."

"FOUR runs, classic the batsman! Good length on middle, and the batsman flat-bats it over Fizz's head with ease. Proper swing of the bat, and the shot is too well hit for Pollard to intercept."
"1 run, non-turning legbreak on middle, trickles it away into the leg side."
"1 run, chipped wide of midwicket as he looks to pull. Length ball is too quick as it angles into him."
"no run, short on off, hangs back and fends it behind to the keeper."
"1 run, flatter ball on off stump, but DK simply drives it past the bowler's left to long off. He'll keep strike."

"no run, a slow bouncer gets some bounce and the batsman lets it go."

"1 run, full just outside off, and that's been comfortably pushed off the front foot to deep extra cover."
"no run, nicely bowled. Full and attacking the stumps, the batsman is aware of that wicket-taking option, so a broad bat comes down to defend.."

"1 run, short, wide, flayed down to deep third man."
"1 run, yorker just outside off, and Hardik does well to squeeze it past Krunal. But where's his bat?! It flew off his gloves and landed near the keeper. Sweaty evening."
"no run, half-tracker on middle stump, but spins into the batsman. Cramped for room, and can't flick it square. Hits his thigh pad."
"1 run, full on leg, but legspin this time. Swept off his pads once again, but this time only to fine leg."
"no run, yorker outside off. Backs away but can't get this drive away. Jammed back down the pitch."
"2 runs, full on leg stump, and worked off his pads to the area near square leg once again. No one there, and Nair has a lot of ground to make up from the deep."

"1 run, good length outside off, and the batsman muscles this down the ground past the bowler's left. He's disappointed with that shot."
"OUT, straight toe extra cover. The the batsman experiment ends quickly. It's a length ball outside off and he can get neither power, or elevation as he tries to clear the fielder there. Russell, the man, slightly wrongfooted - moving to his left - but holds on above his right shoulder."
"1 run, bit too full and Dhawan uses his hard hands to whack it to long on."
"SIX runs, in lot more control this time around. Back of a length, angled into his leg stump, and all the batsman has to do is turn around and help it with a pull over backward square leg."

"1 run, looks like another knuckle ball. At a length and slanted in at middle stump. Tapped wide of mid-on."
"1 run, squeezes this drive to mid off for a quick single."
"1 run, another dipping delivery - this time at top pace - and it messes with the batsman's timing. He has his front leg cleared away. the bowler does well to change his line and keep it wide of off stump. As a result, the batsman has to reach out, and ends up mistiming a bunt to long-on."
"SIX runs, now he adds insult to injury. This is a magnificent loft over extra cover. Picked the legbreak off the hand, wasn't underneath the flight but hit this on the up and this sailed away. Wow."
"no run, better line from the bowler - wider outside off as the batsman tries to sweep but it's out of his reach outside off."

"2 runs, full on middle, and the batsman takes a big stride forward. Gets to the pitch of the ball and slog-sweeps to Stokes at deep midwicket. A good, sliding effort from Stokesy."
"OUT, soft dismissal! Edged to QDK. Good length outside off, and the batsman tries to play the late cut. The ball just about seams away after pitching and that induces the edge. Comfortably taken by the keeper and the bowler is ecstatic!."

"no run, spots the left-hander switching his stance for a reverse scoop and so plants the ball over the wide line to keep it out of the batsman's reach."
"no run, looped up outside off, the bat twists in Faf's hands as he presses forward and slices a drive to cover."
"1 run, excellent yorker on middle stump, and the batsman does well to get his bat down in time. It's inside-edged to short fine leg, and Curran's halfway down the wicket. There's a misfield there, so the batsman chooses to run across as well. Could've been a run-out if Chahar collected the ball cleanly."

"2 runs, another slider from the bowler, he's firing 'em in, whipped with the angle through midwicket."

"1 run, a slower delivery outside off, drilled down to long-off for one.."
"FOUR runs, the bowler lets it go, and Rayudu misfields as well! Tossed up on middle, and the batsman smacks it straight past the bowler. He chooses not to get his hand behind it, but Rayudu - at long off - can't intercept either."

"no run, quicker ball, full on middle stump. the batsman defends off the front foot and sees the over out."

Harshal Patel is three quarters of the way down the pitch for the second, but the throw from deep midwicket is fumbled by Shreevats, but he recovers quickly to get to the ball and then comes up with an underarm flick to beat Harshal's dive. Surely someone's got to have a word with the batsman about his running, very very poor.  Fourth time now that the batsman is involved in a run out this season. He's run his partner out on three of those occasions."
"no run, good length on middle stump, but spins away from the batsman. Punched off the back foot to cover."
"1 bye, offcutter on leg stump, and the batsman's deceived for the pace. Tried to pull but through his shot too early. De Kock can't grab onto it either, so the batsman manages to steal a run."

"1 run, a short ball on the off side, it's a cutter (from the bowler) and the batsman chops it into the off side."

"1 run, walks across the stumps and flicks this full delivery to deep square leg."
"OUT, the bowler lobs it up outside off and gets it to break away further. He forces the batsman to reach out for the ball. the batsman tries to do so but loses his shape. He aims to go over the covers, but instead carves it squarer to Boult at backward point. Over to you, Russell."

"1 run, short of a length on off stump, punched to long-on off the front foot."
"1 run, aargh, it's short again. That's a poor over. Googly outside off, Kishan rocks back and nails his pull to wide long-on for a run.."
"FOUR runs, Rajasthan need six off the last ball! This was full on leg stump, and the batsman lifted it to long on. Iyer prepares himself at long on, but he can't hold on to the catch. Goes to the boundary on the bounce."
"no run, carrom ball first up to the left-hander. It dips even as the batsman stretches forward to reach it. Misses the flick and hits the pad.."

"no run, good length on off, and the batsman misses again! If this were baseball, he'd be struck out. Tried to defend it towards cover off the back foot."
"FOUR runs, that angle is not working either! Too full outside off, the batsman shows his class by driving that nice and square for four more. Spectacular batting."
"OUT, chopped on! Shortened his length, got this to drift in from around the stumps, Dhawan looks to steer this past slip after first looking to sweep, but didn't have the room and ends up hitting it onto his stumps off an inside edge. His third failure in a row now.."
"FOUR runs, low full toss, very wide outside off. DK gets down on one knee, and carves it over point. KKR need a six, but all they get is a four."

"OUT, oh, he's chopped it on. So the drop doesn't prove as costly. A legsidish slower ball, 113ks, just back of a length. the batsman doesn't pick the drop in pace and tries to whip forcefully. Swings early and gets an inside edge to the thigh pad, before the ball clips the glove as he completes the swing and then takes the bails out."

He realises too late that the single isn't on, and by the time he turns around the throw from Jaydev Unadkat is nearly in Buttler's gloves."
"FOUR runs, nicely done. Full ball on off stump, drilled straight past the non-striker and there's no stopping that."

"SIX runs, back of a length on the hips, the batsman picks it up and launches it over the square leg fence. Such a clean strike from Sixer the batsman."

"OUT, the relay catch! Mayank grabs it at long-off, but he's overbalancing, he knows he will go over the boundary, so he lobs the ball over to Tiwary at long-on and it is seamless. It is poetry. It is very very good. And so the batsman has to go, after smacking a loopy old delivery on leg stump straight down the ground. The percentages were right. But Kings XI outdid him on two counts: the bowler followed his moving away to leg stump. And then Mayank stayed supremely calm on the boundary, leapt up to take the catch over his head, and then relayed the ball through at the perfect height to his mate Tiwary."

"1 run, slow turn from length outside off, steered to sweeper cover."
"1 run, back of a length outside off, and all Sarfraz can do is chop it down to backward point. Scampers across for the single."

"FOUR runs, drilled over mid-off! the bowler making life easy for the batsman today it seems. Length ball on off stump, backs away and slams this flat."
"FOUR runs, thick outside edge and it's too fast for Harbhajan at backward point! Same strategy - backs away to try and go over extra cover. Except he makes too much room to reach this full ball outside off with the middle of the bat. Carved over the fielders behind square."
"no run, looks like a knuckle ball outside off, the batsman delays his shot and dabs to point."
"1 run, looking for the big sweep, flat around off, he improvises a push to long-on."

"1 run, good length on off, and spinning away. the batsman gets onto the back foot and cuts to the man in the deep."
"OUT, an ugly swipe across the line sees the back of the batsman. Nicely floated up around his off-stump, and the batsman is expecting it to turn away. But it simply slides in with the arm and beats the inside edge before clattering into off-stump."

"FOUR runs, short ball angled across and Rinku the batsman waits for it to rise and then ramps it over the slip fielder for a well-placed four."
"no run, beaten! Swung through early to mow over deep midwicket, didn't account for the change in pace. Well-executed slower one."
"FOUR runs, helped over short fine. Too short, too much down leg. Easy."
"1 leg bye, big appeal for lbw but the batsman has gotten well outside off stump for this attempted sweep. It's a full ball, not there for the sweep."

"no run, back of a length on off stump, punches it into the covers."
"FOUR runs, welcomed with a boundary! Full just outside off, and Mayank takes a big step forward before lifting this inside out over cover. A well-executed shot that's played wide of long off."
"1 run, again, the wrong shot, I think. Short and wide outside off, DK sees a big gap at midwicket so he goes back and pulls wide of mid-on. A good stop from Sarfraz, running to his right.."

"2 runs, the bowler shifts his line wider of off, the batsman uses his feet and slices it over backward point."

"1 run, whips this length ball from outside off towards deep midwicket."
"no run, heaves and misses! Short of length and swinging in a bit late, he goes for the mighty pull and the ball goes just under the bat."
"FOUR runs, deja vu! It's outside off, and the batsman once again shuffles towards that side before paddling it over short fine leg again. Does well to get his head out of the ball's way before playing it over his left shoulder. Kings XI need 32 off the final over."
"1 run, good length on middle, but he's done well to take the pace off. the batsman attempts a leg-side drag, but the ball hits his helmet and goes to square leg."

"no run, good length outside off, tapped straight to mid-off on the up."
"SIX runs, smash. the batsman with a reminder that there's some batting left. Hangs deep in the crease, gets a short ball that is also a slower ball. Plenty of time to swing and he manages to lift it over deep midwicket. That's a Chinnaswamy sixer."

"1 run, shortish on middle, angled in, and he pulls with the angle to deep square leg."
"FOUR runs, drilled by the batsman. Full on off, and he gets his front foot out of the way before tonking this past the bowler. The bowler does well not to get his hands to it."

"1 run, nicely bowled - low and dipping delivery on the pads, Dhawan just about tickles it to short fine leg."

"1 run, eases this down to long off with the spin."
"no run, wide of the crease, angling in, straightening and bouncing past the outside edge near the higher part of the bat."
"no run, short of good length around off, stands tall and punches to short cover."
"2 runs, fired on a back of a length on middle, the batsman steps out and hacks it to midwicket off the inside half. He tears back for the second."
"1 run, much fuller but similar line, the batsman presses forward and drives down to long-off."
"no run, Rohit saunters down the track, swings wildly at another outswinger, and does not make contact again. Strange shots from Rohit. He usually takes his time to settle down."
"1 run, uppish but safe! This stopped on the batsman as he looked to punch towards midwicket."
"no run, falls short of cover. the batsman gets in a weird position there. Almost like it's the first time he's encountering a swinging ball. This goes away outside off and he hangs his bat out at it, no control at all."
"1 run, thumps this short of length delivery to sweeper cover. Good work by Mitch."
"no run, short of a length and angling into the thigh, Parthiv does not make contact with it."
"1 leg bye, length ball outside leg, a googly. Looks to sweep but gets it towards short fine off the thigh guard."
"1 run, really full and outside off, hit to long-off to close out the over."
"1 run, good length just outside off, and he backs away to carve it towards deep extra cover."
"FOUR runs, misfield at short fine leg! Harbhajan the man guilty there. Good length on off, and the batsman walks across to try and paddle towards the leg side. The ball takes his under edge, and goes to Harbhajan, but the ball sneaks under the fielder's fingers."
"FOUR runs, finishes with a boundary. A domineering win finished with an imperious shot. Short of a length in the corridor and he gets behind it to swat it over midwicket."
"no run, googly, spins away and bounces outside off, carved to point."
"1 run, goes short, but it's a googly. Down leg. Pulled away to deep square leg.."
"1 run, quick and nipping into the batsman, just about gets his bat down for one towards point. Think he got glove actually."
"OUT, smashed to deep midwicket! Picks out the fielder. A short delivery on off, swatted away to Hardik, who keeps his eyes on it and takes a good reverse-cupped catch. It's Sunrisers' second-lowest IPL total ever.."
"SIX runs, fuller and just a shade outside off, the batsman aims for another loft again, this time he slices it over mid-off. This goes all the way."
"no run, back of a length and skipping away outside off, beats the outside edge near the higher part of the bat."
"1 run, oh stop it, Trent Boult! You show off! Short ball on middle stump, gets back in the crease and pummels this pull shot. Boult leaps to his right at deep midwicket to stop this on the bounce."
"1 run, whips this down to deep midwicket as they jog the single."
"1 run, short of a length, slower at 105.4ks, flicked behind square."
"FOUR runs, full outside off, and the batsman manages to get underneath this! Lifted over extra cover off the bat's sweet spot. The oomph!."
"OUT, mix-up and Shakib will be shown the way eventually. Got none of that from his partner. It's an offcutter that the batsman taps in front of short midwicket with soft hands. Takes the instinctive two steps forward but without a call. No call from Shakib either - they're both looking at the ball. There's no run there. Shakib is halfway down. Midwicket swivels and takes the non-striker's stumps down on the bounce .ah hang on. We've looked at the replays and it sounds like the batsman said yes first and then no.."
"OUT, short ball that bounces uncomfortably in front of him. Tries to fetch a pull and gets a top-edge that settles into the hands of midwicket."
"2 runs, good length just outside off, and drilled off the back foot to deep extra cover. Enough time to jog back for the second run. They'll get some time to recover as well. It's the time out."
"1 run,  dropped  by substitute David Miller at long-on!  He stepped out to loft over long-on but didn't get the elevation. Miller ran in quickly, dived low but couldn't get under it properly.."
"no run, tries to cut a short one and loses shape due to lack of room and gets beaten."
"1 run, another slower ball outside off, the batsman plays early and chips it over the covers."
"no run, short of a length just outside off, wafts at it on the up but misses."
"FOUR runs, spins past the long leg fielder! That's lucky for Sunrisers and the batsman's hogging it all tonight. Sweeps hard. The ball bounces right in front of the fielder and spins past his left hand."
"1 run, quick googly, Rohit picks this from length and turns this to the leg side to get off the mark."
"1 leg bye, slower ball, short on middle. The ball's going down the leg side but the batsman manages to flick this fine past the keeper. Comes off his thigh guard, in fact."
"1 run, bit of flight and it's pitched up a bit, the batsman helps it down to long on this time."
"OUT, yorked! And he's on a hat-trick. It's a full ball on the batsman's toes, and he can't dig it out. He misses the defense and the ball crashes into middle stump. the bowler, you beauty! Takes two in two and KKR are right back in it once again."
"1 run, full toss on middle, turned away to deep fine leg where there's  a fielder guarding the boundary."
"no run, back of a length on off stump, defended off the back foot."
"1 run, flatter and faster, the batsman miscues a slog-sweep to deep midwicket."
"1 wide, slips this full ball way down leg, good take by QdK."
"OUT, gets a leading edge straight to mid-off. the batsman was woefully out of form, was failing to hit anything off the middle and has now paid the price. Looked to hop across and work to the leg side but closed the bat face too early. Are Kings XI fighting back?."
"2 runs, lifts it just over the infield on the off side. No, we have not switched to permanent bold tags to start commentary lines. the batsman living on the edge but doing a great job. Couldn't quite get under this overpitched bal and got it over cover off the toe-end."
"1 run, back of a length and slower outside off, flapped to long-off."
"1 run, good length on off. It's the googly that angles into the batsman's body. Does well to punch it down the ground to long off."
"no run, driven on the up, one bounce to Morris at mid off. The bat face turned in his hand as he made contact."
"FOUR runs, swatted away into the gap at extra cover. It's another short, slower delivery. the batsman picks the variation early enough and thrashes the ball into the gap at cover."
"no run, short, wide, turns away, slapped to point."
"SIX runs, tossed up on off, and too easy for the batsman! One big step forward and then comfortably lifted over the bowler's head. Lands beyond the long-on boundary."
"no run, appeal for lbw but turned down. Full outside off, and angling into him. Tries another reverse sweep, but hits his pad. Impact outside off for certain."
"1 wide, drifts down leg, WIDE!."
"1 run, slower offcutter, grips and bounces, poked to the covers. Well-deserved break for Suryakumar and myself."
"1 run, full and wide outside off, but that's another slower ball from the bowler. Driven firmly, and with the bat's open face, to deep point again."
"1 run, full on off, and he slices it this time. The ball goes to mid-off, allowing them to take the single."
"2 runs, short and wide outside off, and that's been flat-batted towards the bowler. the bowler drops the catch, but manages to go towards mid on to collect the ball. Then has a shy at the stumps, and hey, it's a direct hit! Williamson's just in. So that's two to the total.."
"1 run, sliding into leg stump, tickled off an inside edge to short fine leg."
"no run, short of a length and in at off stump. Defended to point off the back foot."
"no run, turns this straight to square leg. Tight bowling so far from KG."
"no run, advances looking for a slog and ends up swinging early due to the lack of pace."
"1 run, gets forward to block behind third man."
"1 run, carves it away  third man's lining it up . but it falls short! Whoa. Talk about anti-climax! And to make it worse, Mujeeb, the fielder, gets struck in the eye as the ball bounces up at him. He's going off the field."
"1 run, googly, but it's also a long-hop, but it doesn't get the punishment it probably deserves because there's a man back at deep forward square leg to keep it down to one."
"SIX runs, length ball, no room as it angles into him, but he makes use of the inward curve to launch it over long-on."
"SIX runs, full on leg stump, but the batsman drills this over the non-striker! Straight as an arrow. Too full, in fact, and the batsman simple bunts this straight."
"no run, slider, short of a length outside off. Looks to cut and under-edges into the pitch."
"no run, 135 kph, shorter and wider outside off, chopped away to cover.."
"1 run, good length on middle stump, and that's been pulled square. Not him well enough though."
"FOUR runs, hammered for four. A tad too full this time from the bowler, the batsman stays balanced as he drills an on-drive past his partner.."
nan
"FOUR runs, stunning straight drive. Too full, he backed away and hammered this. Straight as an arrow. Long-on and long-off came around but had no chance.."
"1 wide, lifter outside off, flies off the deck, too high, wide."
"SIX runs, over long on! What a talent. Good length outside off, and in the batsman's arc to smack this straight. Hits it through the ball's line, and thumps it over the bowler's head."
"1 run, back of a length and angling away outside off, the batsman uses the angle and angles it down to third man."
nan
"no run, edged, but short of wide slip! 138 kph, a wide yorker outside off. the batsman gets a thick outside edge, with a slight angle of the bat. Short of Rohit, good stop."
"OUT, will the bowler review that? Appeals for the leg before but the signal is four off the bat. Yes, he goes for it. Another legbreak from the bowler. Floats it up just enough to entice the batsman to get down and sweep. There is absolutely no bat involved, which seemed pretty obvious to start off. UltraEdge confirms it, and three reds on Hawkeye as ball crashes into off-stump. Good review. the bowler was super-confident of that and you could see why. That seemed pretty plumb from the outset."
"SIX runs, that's another gift from the bowler. Changes the line and takes it away from the batsman's off-stump, but the length is the same. the batsman easily comes forward to get his weight behind that shot, and deposits it over long-off with minimal effort. Massive over; 22 off it. Game on in Hyderabad."
"FOUR runs, cuts in the air, it lands short and wide of a diving backward point and runs away for four. Too short, not the kind of length you can ball to the batsman. Or anyone."
"no run, skidder outside off, chopped to the off side adjacent to the pitch."
"SIX runs, have you seen that before?! Low full toss and the batsman slices it for six over point! Not a bad ball, only slightly inaccurate but these get punished in the death."
"1 run, spins away to roll to point off a leading edge. the batsman was looking to work this to the leg side."
"2 runs, clean inside-out strike over the infield, down to sweeper cover. Got more elevation this time, safe however.."
"no run, very short outside off, and had the width to be sent over point. But just the extra pace does Manish in. Can't get bat to ball."
"SIX runs, that's a woeful ball. Dropped short, a slower ball, on leg stump. the batsman swivels and sends this flying over the fine leg region with a hoick."
"no run, shorter and outside off, swatted through the line to cover."
"SIX runs, now he switches over to a short length and the batsman crunches a pull over deep midwicket. the bowler getting his lengths all wrong at the death  but CSK still well ahead."
"1 run, good length on off, but doesn't spin into his pads. Pulled off the back foot towards deep midwicket on this occasion."
"1 run, slower ball becomes a full toss on leg stump. the batsman taps it down to long leg."
"SIX runs, Full outside off, and the batsman slaps this over point. Hooda races to his left and sticks his hand out, and even throws the ball in, but his back leg is hitting the boundary."
"1 run, good length just outside off. Punched off the back foot to long on. Successful over from the bowler."
"SIX runs, one-handed six, would you believe it? Went downtown to a length ball but in doing so, the bottom hand came off the grip. Chance for long off? No chance in hell. He was a mere spectator. The bats these days, I tell you."
"1 run, legbreak? tossed on middle, clipped away through square leg."
"1 run, slower short ball outside off, dragged away to deep midwicket."
"1 run, full on leg stump, and that's been driven past midwicket to the man in the deep. Nice crunching sound off the bat."
"1 bye,  stumping chance missed!  Oh, dear. Is that the turning point? the batsman is foxed by a googly that spins back in to beat the inside edge as he stepped out to go over the top. What's worse is the slip fielder's throw at the stumps resulted in an overthrow.."
"no run, steps out to pull but is beaten."
"no run, leading edge. This is why the batsman is tentative against the bowler. Hasn't picked this googly as he looks to flick through midwicket."
"1 run, good length outside off, and angling into KW's body. Opens his bat's face and runs it down to third man."
"FOUR runs, full outside leg stump, and the batsman makes full use of the line. Goes down on one knee, and smacks a sweep to the backward square boundary."
"1 run, flat fuller one, clipped to deep midwicket."
"no run, in the air, but just short of the bower! Back of a length outside off, and it hurries onto the batsman. Tries to defend, but comes off the bat's top half. the batsman stays alive because he played at it with soft hands."
"no run, misses the arm ball and is struck on the back thigh as he looks to pull. Was very deep in the crease at the point of contact, but this was going down."
"2 runs, slower full toss, teasing the line with the height here, the batsman flicks it to deep midwicket."
"1 run, full on middle and off, but angling across the batsman. Thumped off the backfoot, past the non-striker, to long off."
"no run, back of a lent outside off, and the batsman tries to flat-bat it down the ground. Hit straight to mid off."
"2 runs, he's not able to deal with the spin again, and throws hard hands at this fuller one, off the outside of the bat, but lands past the point fielder running back."

"no run, well bowled, a full delivery around off, driven to cover."
"1 run, length ball, gently dabs it to midwicket and takes off for a single."
"no run, full ball outside off, plants the front leg out and yorks himself. Looks to flick and gets it into his toe."
"1 run, back of a length, slightly quicker. Another wrong'un hurrying on towards middle stump, punched to long-off."
"no run, length ball angling in, there's a gentle little nip back in off the pitch to kiss the inside edge as it hit the pad.  A very thin inside edge!  Decision overturned. As an umpire, it's really, really hard to spot such minute deviation off the bat. Correct decision in the end.."
"no run, almost caught and bowled! But drops just short of the bowler. It's back of a length on off, and the ball comes off the bat's top half. Lobs into the air, but falls before the bowler could recover."
"OUT, short ball, downfall. Another batsman finds the fielder off a half-tracker. It's the pace that's doing it. So slow from the bowler, halfway down the pitch. It's a googly but at that length it doesn't matter. the batsman just has to generate too much power on this occasion. Mis-times and finds deep midwicket."
"no run, nails the backfoot cover drive, but finds the fielder again.."
"no run, back of a length, slight turn away, the batsman slaps it to point."
"1 run, length ball around middle, whips it away to deep square leg."
"no run, looked like an offcutter outside off, the batsman gets a thick inside edge to cover."
"no run, good length outside off, and cut off the back foot. Mistimed to Narine at point."
"FOUR runs, this is just helped on its way over deep backward square. Stunning shot. Too slow and drifting down, this was almost as if the batsman was waiting for it as he swung through with the angle.."
"no run, length and slanted across off. Shuffles to try and tickle one behind square. Can't get it off the pitch."
"FOUR runs, it's too short again. A long hop, Suryakumar the batsman hurries back and swats a pull into the gap at midwicket for four. Archer gets across to his left, but allows the ball to go through. Naughtily."
"1 run, squeezes the drive wide of cover for an easy single."
"no run, good length on off and forces the batsman to tiptoe. Defended with soft hands towards the leg side."

"1 run, dropped short and wide outside off, the batsman makes additional room by backing away. Slapped away to the off-side sweeper."

"no run, extremely full outside off, the batsman drills it out to mid-off."
"1 run, full. Angled in at leg stump. Backs away and taps it to mid-off."
"no run, slower bouncer, the batsman is early into a pull and only collects fresh air."
"no run, much fuller and outside off, squeezed to the covers."
"2 runs, very short on leg stump, and enough time for the batsman to get in position. Goes deep onto the back foot and thumps this down the ground to wide long on."
"FOUR runs, crunched over midwicket! Good length on off, but the batsman walks across to the off side and checks a pull shot over the infield. Placed to perfection, and what a way to get to your first IPL 2018 fifty!."
"SIX runs, one-handed six over long-on. He can walk on water tonight? Bhuvi shortens his length, the batsman holds his shape and then wallops this."
"no run, flat outside off, punched to mid-off from the back foot.."
"no run, good length outside off, and the batsman chooses to play this fine. Cut straight to short third man though."
"no run, length ball that tails away a tad late outside off, the batsman is a long way away from the line, and swings and misses."
"no run, on a length on off, defended back."
"1 run, Axar loops it up outside off and gets it to break away, driven with the spin to sweeper cover."
"no run, full at middle stump, defended into the leg side."
"1 wide, short and wide outside off. Too wide, in fact, and the batsman's happy to let it go."
"FOUR runs, slower ball yorker, but outside leg stump. the batsman checks his shot, and eventualy whips it off his toes. Played over square leg, and no one's there in the deep.."
"OUT, opens up the leg side and pulls this short ball from outside off, but can only hit it as far as Stokes at deep midwicket. No timing whatsoever on that.."
"no run, beaten by pace. Again. the bowler has been unreadable off the pitch. This isn't a great ball though, short and wide. Too late on the cut."
"1 run, cramps the batsman! Aimed at leg stump, and with the batsman backing away, it's a perfect delivery. the batsman tried to pull, but in trying to protect himself, he plays it back to the bowler."

"no run, bouncer on middle, 142ks, flies past the hook."
"FOUR runs, slightly short, slightly wide. Enough for the batsman to slash a cut through point."
"OUT, The DJ starts the party first ball! Offcutter, and short outside off. the batsman doesn't pick the pace up and tries to drag his pull. Takes the bat's toe end, goes in the air, and taken easily by first slip in the end. Royals spiraling downhill fast."
"1 leg bye, 135 kph, that's close? Was there some bat? A low full toss on leg, the batsman misses the flick, the ball takes the pad en route to fine leg. If there was no bat, that should have been out.."
"1 run, full on off, and delivers the cutter this time. the batsman does well to judge the pace and pushes it past Hardik to long off."
"SIX runs, the bottom hand comes off the blade as he goes down on one knee to slog, still clears long-on. Wow, this is a very cruel game to the bowlers, especially here at the Chinnaswamy."
"FOUR runs, short, wide, through cover and point this time as he gets on top of the bounce and slaps it away."
"no run, pitched up on off, presses forward and drives to cover."

"no run, has he got him? the batsman looks to biff this over midwicket, misses. Struck on the pad."
"FOUR runs, half-tracker outside off, and the batsman flat-bats it straight past the bowler! He tried to get his hands to it, but did well to not get his fingertips to it. That would've stung. Crashes into the long-off boundary."
"1 run, short and spinning away outside off, the batsman goes back and laces the wrong'un to sweeper cover."
"2 runs, starts with a slow off cutter on middle and leg, the batsman nudges it to leg and they took a single at normal pace and realised no fielder was sprinting in on the ball so take one more. Plenty of 30-plus players in CSK."

"2 runs, whips this down to fine leg where Sodhi dishes out a sliding stop to save a couple of runs."
"OUT, edged and taken! This is lovely bowling. Set him up perfectly for this dismissal. First there was the awayswinger, then the inswinger, and then the one that swings away again. the batsman pushes forward with hard hands and gets a thick edge to Watson at first slip. Terrific start for CSK."
"no run, short, wide, bounces, beats the outside edge."
"FOUR runs, makes room and punches this length ball through extra cover, Stokes was after it but the ball kept gathering pace as it raced off the turf.."
"no run, back of a length outside off, and he tries to cut it late! Almost chops it onto his stumps, clearly deceived by the change up from the bowler. Was too close to his body for that shot anyway."
"1 run, premeditates a sweep and only just pulls it off, with the bat hacking down on the ball like an axe."
"no run, length ball on off stump, gets on the back foot and tickles it to short fine off the inside edge. That came on quicker than he anticipated."

"1 run, touch short and drifting in, worked towards midwicket."
"SIX runs, three in three! Short on off, and the batsman swivels to pull. Off the bat's middle and it lands beyond the man at cow corner. The KKR dugout can't believe it."
"FOUR runs, outside edge past slip! Oh the bowler will think about this all night if the batsman makes runs today! He's beaten him in flight, got the ball to turn away from length outside off and induced an edge.  Slip is very very wide and that's four."
"FOUR runs, short and wide, too much width. Cut over backward point for four. That's very clever batting. Nicely chopped away.."
"2 runs, short on middle and leg, swatted away to deep square leg for a couple. A 50-run stand."
"1 run, the googly down leg. the batsman works it down to fine leg. Would have been wide had he left the ball.."

"1 leg bye, the batsman backs away outside leg, the bowler follows him and hits the pad."

"2 runs, the flat one on the pads, worked away to deep square leg."
"1 run, full on off stump, flicked to deep midwicket's right."

"1 run, hits the yorker length, the batsman knocks it down to long-on."
"FOUR runs, a slower ball on middle and leg, Suryakumar just tucks the ball into the gap. A half push. And he finds the gap at midwicket for four. Excellent execution.."
"SIX runs, high and long! Lunges forward for the length delivery and gets under the ball really well to send that flying over long on. the bowler shut his eyes as soon as the batsman launched it."
"no run, height may have saved the batsman. This ball pitches at length on off and skids straight on. the batsman looks to play across the line, misses it and is struck on the flap of his right pad. It comes back as umpire's call.  On field not out stays.  Rod Tucker was the umpire in question.."
"FOUR runs, the batsman shuffles across off stump, drops down to one knee, and laps a length ball away to the fine leg boundary. No protection in the deep."
"1 run, a bit of flight on leg, Kishan stays low and nails his sweep to deep midwicket for one, all along the ground.."
"no run, back of a length around off, punched from the crease."
"SIX runs, Shanked! Back of a length on middle stump, and he backs away to flat-bat it over deep midwicket. Wonderful use of the crease's depth to earn that extra second."
"2 runs, full just outside off stump. He walks across to the off side, and flicks it off his toes to the deep midwicket boundary. Man in the deep does well to intercept."
"1 run, short outside off, and Bhuvi's also taken the pace off this. the batsman flat-bats it over Shankar, but lands well short of long on."
"(no ball), surely that's one warning for a beamer. This perhaps slipped out as he tried a back-of-the-hand slower ball. Had the batsman on the floor, Rahul scampers to his left to stop that.."
"no run, slower ball at a length, wide outside off. Looks to slap it on the up and gets an under-edge towards point."
"1 run, offbreak outside off, slices it to backward point and they sprint across for a quick one."
"FOUR runs, loopier and fuller outside off, enough width for Suryakumar to collapse his back leg and lace a drive between sweeper cover and wide long-off. Impeccable placement again from Suryakumar."
"no run, slower offcutter, dropped short and moving past the back shoulder. the batsman lets it go."

"no run, a nice and full start. Full and moving away, on middle and off, punched away to mid-off from the crease."
"1 wide, OUT, stumped! Down the leg side. It was full on leg stump, and the batsman came charging down the wicket. The ball angles down leg, and Buttler's excellent behind the stumps. Quick to remove the bails, CHG has to go!."
"no run, very full and on off stump, defended back to the bowler."
"SIX runs, that's an easy one, just the kind of delivery you want as a batsman when you're out of form. A clean swing of the arms to dispatch a full, flighted one over long-on."

"no run, the batsman ventures down the track, yorks himself, but digs it out."
"1 run, right into the blockhole, he backs away and squeezes this to long off."
"SIX runs, full outside off, and the batsman's done waiting. Makes room to the leg side and muscles this over the bowler's head.

"OUT, horrendous running and De Kock has ended up sacrificing his wicket. There is no run there.

He's on the back foot, very deep in the crease it looks very out right now as we wait for the tracker. There's no edge on it .it's out! Decision will be overtuned. S Ravi gets a fairly straightforward one wrong. the batsman is gone, that's hitting middle and off.."

Bobbled out, tried to grab on the second attempt but couldn't.."

"1 run, slower cutter outside off, glided away to third man."
"FOUR runs, full and angling away, the batsman drills this to wide long off where Karun Nair can't bend down in time to cut that off. Tried to parry it. Lazy effort, should've been stopped."

It's another cutter, around middle and leg. the batsman gets enough bat on a wristy whip, but he picks out midwicket at a comfortable height too. The reverse-cupped hands over his head does the job for Krunal. the batsman gestures that he wanted to hit the ball wider of the fielder, like all batsmen try to do.."

"no run, even fuller and slanting in at off, Rohit has another mighty hack at it and inside-edges the ball  back to the bowler. CSK bowlers threatening both edges on a grassy pitch."
"OUT, some DK brilliance there to convert that into a wicket. Magnificent back-handed flick onto the stumps off his right hand. Smart bowling from the bowler too. Saw the batsman step out, so he shortened his length and fired this in, the batsman looks to turn this to the leg side but ends up getting little bat on it. Karthik moves swiftly to his left, picks the ball up and flicks it back. I suspect the batsman took it easy and was done in by DK's speed. Stunning work.."

"FOUR runs, smokes it over the in-field after getting the front leg out of the way. Lifted from front of off over extra cover."
"OUT, the batsman run out ball watching! Plays a glorious late cut to find backward point. Looks at his partner then at the fielder. Is caught looking at the fielder when his partner responds and comes through for the run. They're both at the same end, nearly. Buttler falls to his knees - he knows what's coming. A throw on the bounce to the bowler as the batsman makes a desperate attempt to run back. the bowler receives, turns and flicks it onto the stumps with an underarm throw. Raina was the man at backward point."

"1 run, flat outside off, punched to long-on for a run."
"FOUR runs, the batsman shimmies out again, this time he clears mid-on. He manufactures a half-volley by venturing out of the crease. Dragged from outside off over mid-on. the batsman did not middle it but he will not complain."
"no run, slower length ball on off, defended from the crease."

He dabs it gently to the off side of the pitch and takes off looking for the quick single. the bowler moves quickly in his follow-through, picks up and throws at the batsman's end and misses.

"no run, length ball angling away, the batsman punches this to mid-off."
"no run, back of a length, stays back and whips it against the turn between midwicket and long-on."

"1 run, on the stumps this time and the batsman kind of slog-sweeps it to leg."
"no run, full, wide and just inside the wide line this time. the batsman reaches out to beat point but can't lay bat to it."
"2 runs, yorker outside off, can't get under this for the slog. It dribbles wide of long-on who puts in a good throw on the bounce, but the bowler can't collect this one-handed to effect the run out. Bravo would have been short."

"no run, gets across the stumps and dabs this away-going length delivery."
"1 run, shuffles across to a fuller one and pierces short cover diving forward with a smooth drive."
"1 run, goes back, thinking this short ball is a legbreak, but it nips back in and messes with his cut shot."

"1 run, a googly, outside off, swept to deep square leg. Too full."

"1 run, back of a length on off, and comfortably clipped off his pads to the man at deep midwicket. They jog across."
"1 run, it clears cover, and they complete the run. Delhi celebrate.

And Delhi Daredevils complete a thrilling seven-wicket win against Mumbai.."

"no run, good length and rips away outside off, beats the outside edge again."
"2 runs, short and outside off, wallops it to sweeper cover . and do we have a run-out?. Miller subbing for Mujeeb sends in a lovely throw - flat and hard and right over the stumps - but Yusuf's dive saves him."

"OUT, the batsman ventures down the track and skies it. Rohit runs across to his right from extra cover, this was the bowler's catch but he leaves it to his captain.

"OUT, the bowler catches the batsman on the crease. Umpire Gaffney shoots down the appeal but Mumbai choose to review. This is pretty plumb. Another skiddy googly, full and breaks back in to beat the inside edge and hit the back pad in line with middle stump. the batsman did not pick the variation. This is cannoning into middle stump. The tracker returns three reds. Umpire Gaffney reverses his decision and sends the batsman back. Where will CSK go from here?."

"no run, back of a length and outside off, opens the face and guides it to backward point."

"1 wide, full and wide outside leg stump. the batsman tries to clip it towards the leg side, but too wide in fact. Extras."
